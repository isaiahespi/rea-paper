<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Distorted Nation: Perceptions of Racial/Ethnic Group Sizes and Attitudes Toward Immigrants and Other Minorities;,citation_abstract=Using a special module (MEUS) of the 2000 General Social Survey, we investigate Americans perceptions of the racial and ethnic composition of the United States. We show that, because of innumeracy, it is critical to gauge perceptions through relative, rather than absolute, group sizes. Even so, it appears that, as of 2000, roughly half of Americans believed that whites had become a numerical minority; such perceptions were even more common among minority-group members than among whites. Majority-group respondents perceptions of the relative sizes of minorities affect their attitudes towards immigrants, blacks and Hispanics, with those having the most distorted perceptions holding the most negative attitudes. Although perceptions of group sizes in the nation are linked to the perceived racial/ethnic composition of the communities where respondents reside, the effects of the former on attitudes are largely independent of the latter. Our findings highlight the frequently overlooked value of an old bromide against prejudice: education.;,citation_author=Richard Alba;,citation_author=RubÃ©n G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=VetBros: Masculinity, Militarism, Patriotism, and the Post-9/11 Veteran;,citation_abstract=The first two decades of the 21st century were marked by protracted wars fought by the United States. In addition to killing and displacing millions of Afghans and Iraqis, these wars called to question long-standing assumptions about the US military and its personnel. They challenged conceptions of patriotic obligations by relying on an âAll-Volunteer Force,â a first for a prolonged conflict, and they challenged conceptions of military masculinity with the inclusion of women in combat roles. One response among some military veterans is seen in the rise of so-called âVetBros.â A VetBro is a stereotype, often used dismissively, to represent overbearing and aggressive veterans who interpret everything through their veteran identity and who express themselves with conspicuous displays of masculinity and patriotism which they see as linked to militarism and violence. VetBros show the effects of broader problems in the relationship between state, society, and military that emanate from tensions in military culture with the waging of, at the time, seemingly endless wars of occupation by a democratic society. In this dissertation I examine different ways VetBros have expressed their understandings of the military, patriotism, masculinity by looking at how they express their veteran identity in war memoirs, a streaming video comedy network, military-themed lifestyle branding, and political campaigns. Through these various media I show how VetBros construct an identity and image united by similar styles of fashion, communication, and their assertions that they represent an authentic veteran identity. Military veterans have traditionally received a great deal of cultural capital to define matters like patriotism and masculinity and, as my analysis shows, VetBros believe that they have a privileged place among veterans to define these matters. Importantly, they see masculinity and patriotism as inextricably linked to militaristic beliefs and the justification of violent action. Due to the culturally symbolic position of veterans in the US, the VetBro visions of aggressive patriotism and masculinity may give legitimacy to support greater militarization of US society, justify war crimes abroad, and encourage vigilante violence at home.;,citation_author=John E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Effect of Election Administration on Voter Confidence: A Local Matter?;,citation_abstract=The 2000 presidential election was a wake-up call to elected leaders, public officials, and election scholars. The electoral fiascoâmost prominent in Florida, but also taking place in states like New Mexico and Ohioârevealed many deficiencies in voting equipment (Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project 2001). In addition to faulty equipment, registration mix-ups and problems with absentee ballots led to the loss of as many as six million votes (Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project 2001). Confusing ballots, like the butterfly ballot in Floridaâs Dade County, were found to have led voters to vote incorrectly (Wand et al. 2001). While these problems have, no doubt, existed for a long time, the closeness of the 2000 presidential race and the fact that the number of lost votes had the power to change the election outcome have brought election administration questions to the forefront of policy making.Results were first presented at âThe Future of Election Reform and Ethics in the States,â hosted by Kent State University, Department of Political Science, Columbus, Ohio, January 16â17, 2007, and the following paper was presented at the Midwest Political Science Associationâs Annual Meeting, Chicago, Illinois, April 12â15, 2007.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The role of gender and veteran status in healthcare access among a national sample of U.S. Adults with unhealthy alcohol use;,citation_abstract=Background: Routine healthcare access is critical to reduce drinking and its effects, yet little is known about Veteran and gender differences in routine healthcare access among unhealthy drinkers. The current study examined differences in routine healthcare access, stratified by Veteran status and gender, among a national sample of adults endorsing unhealthy drinking. Method: Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâs 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System National Survey, we identified adults who endorsed unhealthy drinking over the past month (N = 58,816; 41.4% female; 2.7% female Veterans). Bivariate and multivariable analyses modeled associations between gender, Veteran status, and their interaction in predicting routine healthcare access. All multivariable models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Veterans with unhealthy alcohol use reported high rates of routine healthcare access (e.g., $&amp;amp;amp;gt;$86% sought care in the past 2 years) and were less likely to experience a cost barrier to care (aOR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.62â0.92). Females were more likely than males to report better access to care but also to experience a cost barrier (aOR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.10â1.37). The interaction between Veteran status and gender was non-significant. Conclusions: Overall, healthcare access was better for Veterans and females with unhealthy alcohol use compared to civilians and males with unhealthy alcohol use. However, given that females were more likely to report a cost barrier, future implementation research aiming to improve equity in care may want to explore reasons for cost barriers and develop strategies to help reduce these barriers in order to eliminate gender disparities in primary care-based alcohol-related care.;,citation_author=Rachel L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perceptions of Electoral Fairness and Voter Turnout;,citation_abstract=Previous research has established a link between turnout and the extent to which voters are faced with a âmeaningfulâ partisan choice in elections; this study extends the logic of this argument to perceptions of the âmeaningfulnessâ of electoral conduct. It hypothesizes that perceptions of electoral integrity are positively related to turnout. The empirical analysis to test this hypothesis is based on aggregate-level data from 31 countries, combined with survey results from Module 1 of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems survey project, which includes new and established democracies. Multilevel modeling is employed to control for a variety of individual- and election-level variables that have been found in previous research to influence turnout.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Confidence in US Elections After the Big Lie;,citation_abstract=This paper examines how individual-level partisanship and state-level factors affect perceptions of electoral integrity in the United States. We find that evaluations of the integrity of the 2020 US presidential election national outcome were only modestly conditioned by the quality of election administration in a personâs state. Perceptions of electoral legitimacy were much more substantially conditioned by motivated reasoning associated with a personâs partisanship, the partisan context Republicans resided in, and Republican partisansâ residence in a swing-state where final results from 2020 were delayed due to late-counted ballots. Overall, estimated effects of the quality of election administration on confidence in elections are null or modest. Partisan factors associated with Donald Trumpâs âBig Lieâ about the 2020 US presidential election were the strongest forces predicting lack of confidence in US elections and perceptions that election officials were altering results. These factors were not evident in 2016. We discuss how these findings may reflect a fundamental alteration of attitudes among Republican voters and elites about the legitimacy of democratic elections in the US, rather than reflecting cyclical variation in partisan confidence associated with which party won the past election.;,citation_author=Shaun Bowler;,citation_author=Todd Donovan;,citation_publication_date=2024-03-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-03-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/10659129231206179;,citation_issn=1065-9129;,citation_volume=77;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Political Research Quarterly;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What Triggers Public Opposition to Immigration? Anxiety, Group Cues, and Immigration Threat;,citation_abstract=We examine whether and how elite discourse shapes mass opinion and action on immigration policy. One popular but untested suspicion is that reactions to news about the costs of immigration depend upon who the immigrants are. We confirm this suspicion in a nationally representative experiment: news about the costs of immigration boosts white opposition far more when Latino immigrants, rather than European immigrants, are featured. We find these group cues influence opinion and political action by triggering emotionsâin particular, anxietyânot simply by changing beliefs about the severity of the immigration problem. A second experiment replicates these findings but also confirms their sensitivity to the stereotypic consistency of group cues and their context. While these results echo recent insights about the power of anxiety, they also suggest the public is susceptible to error and manipulation when group cues trigger anxiety independently of the actual threat posed by the group.;,citation_author=Ted Brader;,citation_author=Nicholas A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Restoring Trust in US Elections through Effective Election Administrator Messaging;,citation_abstract=During the 2020 election cycle, numerous national, state, and local organizations mounted campaigns designed to counter mis- and disinformation about election activities and to foster public trust in election processes. Local and state election offices focused intently on creating and disseminating accurate messages about when, where, and how to vote. Despite these efforts, trust in the 2020 election remained confoundingly low. This research analyzes this disconnect between messages from election offices and public trust by testing messages collected from election officials around the country using focus groups and a national panel survey experiment. We find that in focus groups, neutral messages that evoke local connections tested better than other types of messages. Further, messenger characteristics influenced whether participants trusted the messages. Using messages based on these findings, we fielded a survey experiment during the 2022 midterm election cycle, finding that the interaction between baseline trust, racial identification, and identification with the messenger moves trust.;,citation_author=Mitchell Brown;,citation_author=Kathleen Hale;,citation_author=Soren Jordan;,citation_author=Ryan D Williamson;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae033;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=National Symbols as Agents of Psychological and Social Change;,citation_abstract=National symbols pervade most contemporary societies, and public policies encourage the displays of these symbols, yet little research has considered the psychological and social effects of exposure to national symbols. The current review integrates theorizing across social science disciplines and proposes that national symbols are not passive fixtures of peopleâs environment, but instead may yield significant psychological and social effects. Empirically supported intraindividual consequences include enhanced national identification and the promotion of group unity at an unconscious level.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=From Confidence to Convenience: Changes in Voting Systems, Donald Trump, and Voter Confidence;,citation_abstract=A growing body of research indicates that votersâ perceptions of the electoral system change when the means of administering elections change. As some electoral jurisdictions have moved to systems designed to increase voter convenience, little is known about whether convenience is achieved at the expense of confidence. Utahâs rollout of Vote by Mail (VBM) occurred county by county across five federal elections, and the three most populous counties adopted all VBM elections successively in 2014, 2016, and 2018. This meaningful variance in voter experience with VBM allows us to model the relationship between experience with VBM and voter confidence. We find that the switch to a more convenient system of voting came at the expense of diminished confidence in the voting process. However, experience with VBM is positively related to confidence such that the loss in confidence can be recouped over time. To capture this dynamic relative to other factors, we also estimate the effects of partisanship and the messages of political elites. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, the effect of partisanship on voter confidence changed compared to just two years earlier. Elite messages appear to be especially negative for Trump voters after 2020. More experience with VBM acts as a bulwark against those negative messages, almost completely attenuating the negative effects of Trumpâs fraud claims among his voters with the highest levels of VBM experience.;,citation_author=Luke Carter;,citation_author=Ashlan Gruwell;,citation_author=J Quin Monson;,citation_author=Kelly D Patterson;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae034;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Autocratization Spillover: When Electing an Authoritarian Erodes Election Trust across Borders;,citation_abstract=The rich literature on election trust predominantly uses domestic determinants as explanatory factors. But given the international nature of the autocratization wave, can an autocratization event across borders erode election trust? This article argues that an authoritarianâs electoral success in a neighboring country can shatter democratic norms and demonstrate the viability of authoritarians. This autocratization event abroad can thus reduce citizensâ principled support for democracy and its political system. Consequently, citizens across borders are less likely to see democratic elections as the âonly game in townâ and they have less trust in elections. To test this idea, I study the spillover effects of the 2018 Brazilian presidential election, in which an authoritarian candidate won decisively. Using the AmericasBarometer in Colombia that was launched throughout this election, I find that the election trust of Colombian citizens erodes after Jair Bolsonaroâs electoral success. To probe into the mechanism, I uncover that his electoral victory leads Colombian citizens to be less supportive of the domestic political system and reduces their principled support for democracy. The causal mediation analysis demonstrates that these two variables mediate the effect of the authoritarianâs electoral success on election trust. These findings on autocratization spillover effects illustrate the importance of external autocratization events in the study of election trust.;,citation_author=Ka Ming Chan;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae018;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">

Selection, Socialization, and the Political Attitudes of Military Veterans;,citation_abstract=Although an initial wave of research during the Vietnam War era suggested that the political attitudes of American veterans were not significantly different from those of the public at large, more recent studies argue that this may no longer be true. Thus far, however, the reason for this difference has gone unexplored: are veterans from the volunteer era different because a certain type of person is drawn to military life (selection), or are their attitudes shaped by their experience of service (socialization)? Using new survey data on the political attitudes of Americans, and statistical techniques designed to improve our estimation of the difference between selection and socialization effects, we examine this question, assessing the extent to which the two factors play a role in this attitudinal difference.

Early studies reveal that poll workers play a major role in the way voters feel about their voting experience. Using exit poll data on the delivery of service at the polling locations, we study the determinants of reactions to poll workers. We find poll worker evaluations are responsive to wait times, feelings of privacy while voting, poll worker training, and special poll worker recruiting efforts, to name a few.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Partisan Poll Watchers and Americansâ Perceptions of Electoral Fairness;,citation_abstract=Poll watchers play an increasingly visible role in American elections, yet there is little research into how their presence shapes beliefs about electoral integrity. On the one hand, poll watchersâlike other election observersâmay lead voters to be more trusting in elections. On the other hand, poll watchers who expressly represent political parties may contribute to polarized views of electoral integrity. We address this gap with two conjoint experiments and one vignette experiment administered on large national samples. The conjoint experiments vary several features of election polling locations, including the presence of poll watchers, voter identification requirements, and other election regulations. We find that regulations around poll watchers shape views of election fairness, but that the nature of this influence depends on the type and partisanship of poll watchers who are present. The vignette experiment shows that perceptions of poll watchers decline when these individuals act in bad faith; effects are especially large for Republican respondents. These findings help identify the potential that poll watchers have to shape Americansâ beliefs about election fairness and integrity.;,citation_author=Mollie J Cohen;,citation_author=Geoffrey Sheagley;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae024;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Measuring the Extent to Which Voter Fraud Beliefs Link Election Reforms to Voter Confidence in the United States;,citation_abstract=Proponents of restrictive voting policies argue that they are necessary to reduce fraud beliefs and instill confidence in elections. However, recent scholarship examining this dynamic in the United States finds that the effects of voting restrictions on fraud beliefs and voter confidence differ by party, suggesting the extent to which fraud beliefs undergird this relationship may also differ by party. Whether voter fraud beliefs tie voter restrictions to voter confidence is inherently important given the assumed role of voter fraud beliefs and voter restrictions in increasing voter confidence, an issue well highlighted in the 2020 election. This study contributes to this literature by measuring the extent to which voter fraud beliefs undergird the relationship between restrictive election policies and voter confidence among Republicans and Democrats. Findings suggest that voter fraud beliefs play a significant and substantive mediating role for Republicans but not Democrats, in line with prominent theories arguing that partisan elite signaling colors electoral reform perceptions.;,citation_author=Joseph A Coll;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae026;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">

Marion County (2008), the Supreme Court ruled that voter identification requirements are lawful on the grounds that, even if they do not prevent fraud, they can instill confidence in voting. However, this reasoning ignores the historical and contemporary racial biases in the enactment and administration of restrictive voting policies in the United States. This legacy likely colors the extent to which Black and white voters see reforms as deterring fraud versus increasing suppression, and as such, how confident they are in election outcomes. We examine how increasing voter restrictions affects voter fraud beliefs and voter confidence among Black and white voters. We find that the enactment of restrictive policies decreases fraud beliefs among white voters but has no effect on fraud beliefs for Black voters; however, Black voters are less confident in elections when conducted with more restrictive policies while white voters are not.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Skeptical American: Revisiting the Meanings of Trust in Government and Confidence in Institutions;,citation_abstract=This paper critically analyzes the survey literature on trust in government and confidence in institutions. It highlights the gap between theoretical understandings of trust which encompass trust, lack of trust, and distrust, next to empirical realizations which fail to consider active distrust of government. Using a specially tailored survey designed for this project, the paper is the first which directly compares competing operationalizations of trust and distrust. The most frequently used measures, both from the National Election Studies and the General Social Survey, tend to exaggerate the level of disaffection compared to a new measure especially designed to run from active trust, which anticipates that the government will do the right thing, to active distrust, the expectation that it will do the wrong thing. Multivariate analyses reveal statistically significant differences in the underlying determinants of these measures. The conventional NES measure in particular is more influenced by short-term evaluations of political events and leaders; our new measure of active trust/distrust taps a more deeply seated orientation toward government.;,citation_author=Timothy E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Americanness, Masculinity, and Whiteness: How Michigan Militia Men Navigate Evolving Social Norms.;,citation_abstract=This dissertation is based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork and 40 in-depth interviews with members of the Michigan militia. Militia members are mostly white men who believe in an originalist interpretation of the Constitution. Armed with rifles, they practice paramilitary exercises and protest various government actions. Militia members see themselves as &amp;amp;amp;quot;super citizens&amp;quot; who embody national ideals of freedom and equality even as they face public criticism as being violent, socially regressive, and racist. My dissertation examines how members respond to changing ideas about equality and inclusion while belonging to a group that lauds a mythic vision of the nation where white men had exclusive social power. I find that most militia members genuinely try to be egalitarian, and the ways in which they fail are instructive regarding white menâs conceptualizations of other groups. I argue that an idealized national identity, strongly influenced by mythical stories of the countryâs founding, shapes membersâ responses to a variety of issues. Specifically, I find that members use the militia space to test and expand constructions of what it means to be a man in contemporary U.S. society even as they reference themes of a traditional, hegemonic masculinity when explaining their militia participation. Regarding race, militia members tend to be accepting of African Americans, but make very little effort to accept Muslim Americans. I argue that members have largely integrated anti-racist norms about African Americans, but they fear physical harm and change to an idealized national identity from Muslims as a result of past violence and attendant political change. Militia membersâ relationship to authority, primarily embodied by law enforcement actors is similarly complex. Members are likely to comply with authoritative actions they understand to be legitimate and in accordance with Constitutional principles and defy those actions they understand to be illegitimate. This work challenges current understandings of masculinity and whiteness, particularly among lower-middle class, American men as it shows that men who strongly value a mythical American identity that is premised on the social power of white men nonetheless consciously grapple with issues of gendered and raced equality.;,citation_author=Amy Cooter;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/98077;,citation_language=en-US;">

We hypothesize that: (1) more liberal operational ideology is associated with more NVP, (2) less electoral trust is associated with more NVP, and (3) operational ideology moderates the negative relationship between electoral trust and NVP. Using data from the 2020 American National Election Study (Nâ=â8,280), our contribution is threefold: We first add to previous research that indicated liberals engage in more NVP than conservatives. We then provide some of the first evidence to suggest that electoral trustâin this case, trust prior to the 2020 electionâis negatively associated with NVP. Results further indicate that the negative relationship between electoral trust and NVP is strongest among those with conservative operational ideology, such that the more trust those with conservative operational ideology have in the election, the less they engage in NVP. Given that electoral trust is crucial for a well-functioning democracy, the implication is that elites with a strategic incentive to express contempt for the election process can have direct and downstream consequences on political participation.;,citation_author=Erin B Fitz;,citation_author=Kyle L Saunders;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae025;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Access or Experience? Determinants of Distrust in US Elections;,citation_abstract=Recent partisan claims about the illegitimacy of the 2020 election highlight a need to better understand the determinants underlying Americansâ trust in the electoral process. In this study, we focus on African Americans and conservatives, two groups that stand out both historically and contemporaneously for high levels of distrust in elections. Utilizing nationally representative survey data, we analyze the degree to which election distrust is associated with respondentsâ attitudes towards policies addressing voter access (photo ID requirements, vote by-mail, and felon voting), perceptions of disenfranchisement, and their personal experience while voting. We find evidence that distrust is not tied to oneâs personal voting experience, but rather to oneâs policy attitudes towards electoral access. Importantly, for conservative and Black voters, the policy remedies that would lead to increased trust for one group would only further exacerbate the concerns of the other, suggesting that distrust towards American elections will be difficult to attenuate.;,citation_author=Sean Freeder;,citation_author=Enrijeta Shino;,citation_publication_date=2024-03-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-03-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/1532673X231220921;,citation_issn=1532-673X;,citation_volume=52;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=American Politics Research;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does military veteran status and deployment history impact officer involved shootings? A caseâcontrol study;,citation_abstract=Background Despite veteransâ preference hiring policies by law enforcement agencies, no studies have examined the nature or effects of military service or deployments on health outcomes. This study will examine the effect of military veteran status and deployment history on law enforcement officer (LEO)-involved shootings. Methods Ten years of data were extracted from Dallas Police Department records. LEOs who were involved in a shooting in the past 10 years were frequency matched on sex to LEOs never involved in a shooting. Military discharge records were examined to quantify veteran status and deployment(s). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of veteran status and deployment history on officer-involved shooting involvement. Results Records were abstracted for 516 officers. In the adjusted models, veteran LEOs who were not deployed were significantly more likely to be involved in a shooting than non-veteran officers. Veterans with a deployment history were 2.9 times more likely to be in a shooting than non-veteran officers. Conclusions Military veteran status, regardless of deployment history, is associated with increased odds of shootings among LEOs. Future studies should identify mechanisms that explain this relationship, and whether officers who experienced firsthand combat exposure experience greater odds of shooting involvement.;,citation_author=Jennifer M Reingle Gonzalez;,citation_author=Stephen A Bishopp;,citation_author=Katelyn K Jetelina;,citation_author=Ellen Paddock;,citation_author=Kelley Pettee Gabriel;,citation_author=M Brad Cannell;,citation_publication_date=2019-09;,citation_cover_date=2019-09;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdy151;,citation_issn=1741-3842;,citation_volume=41;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Public Health;,citation_journal_abbrev=J PUBLIC HEALTH;,citation_publisher=Oxford University Press / USA;">

According to the Resources and Perception Model (RPM) psychosocial resources can prevent this exaggeration, leading to more accurate perception. Two studies tested RPM. Study 1 showed that the perceived closeness of a threatening object (a live tarantula) but not an innocuous object (a cat toy) was moderated by induced self-worth. Further, the more self-worth that participants experienced, the less close the tarantula appeared to them. Study 2 showed that greater levels of self-esteem reduced perceived height, but only among participants prevented from holding a protective handrail while looking down. Together, these studies confirm that resources moderate the physical perception of both distance and height, that resources moderate perception of threats but not nonthreats, that different resources have similar moderating effects, and that psychosocial resources can supplant physical resources.;,citation_author=Kent D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Dynamics of Electoral Manipulation and Institutional Trust in Democracies: Election Timing, Blatant Fraud, and the Legitimacy of Governance;,citation_abstract=This paper explores the dynamic relationship between electoral manipulation and popular trust in political institutions. Governments often manipulate election results by resorting to electoral fraud. They also tilt the electoral field by opportunistically deciding when to hold elections, in other words, election timing maneuvering. How do these two different types of electoral manipulation affect citizensâ trust in the government, legislature, and election management bodies (EMBs)? We suggest that although the short-term effects of election timing manipulation are unclear due to its ambiguous nature as an electioneering strategy, substantial electoral margins created by timing maneuvering facilitate smooth decision-making, leading to boosting trust in the government and legislature over the long run. In contrast, as electoral fraud is an unambiguous form of manipulation, it may undermine trust in the government and parliament, although such effects may not last. By combining an original dataset of election timing with existing survey data comprising 335,000 citizens from fifty-eight democratic countries, we find evidence in support of our theoretical expectations.;,citation_author=Masaaki Higashijima;,citation_author=Hisashi Kadoya;,citation_author=Yuki Yanai;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae022;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">

These veterans have been charged with federal crimes ranging from Obstruction of an Official Proceeding to Assaulting Capitol Police Officers. This paper seeks to answer three questions related to those veteransâ participation in the Capitol Riots. Were their actions patriotic? What were their motivations? And was there anything about their military experience that made these veterans more likely to riot than non-veterans? A content analysis of 71 remarks made by 40 of the veterans arrested, both before and after the riots, was used to ascertain the motivations of those individuals. Analysis of the veteransâ comments revealed that they believed they were acting patriotically; however, closer examination shows that their motivations were more consistent with nationalism than patriotism. Additionally, the military training and combat exposure of the veterans, along with the âStop the Stealâ rhetoric, particularly comments made by former President Donald Trump, also played an integral role in influencing the veterans. The analysis also indicated that the Capitol Riots should be classified as a form of proto-sectarian violence and should serve as a cautionary tale against the growing divisiveness that sparked this incident.;,citation_author=Eric B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Where Do Distrusting Voters Turn if There is No Viable Exit or Voice Option? The Impact of Political Trust on Electoral Behaviour in the Belgian Regional Elections of June 2009;,citation_abstract=It has been suggested that political distrust is associated with lower levels of voter turnout and increased votes for challenger or populist parties. We investigate the relationship between political (dis)trust and electoral behaviour using the 2009 Belgian Election Study. Belgium presents an interesting case because compulsory voting (with an accompanying turnout rate of 90.4 per cent) compels distrusting voters to participate in elections. Nevertheless, distrusting voters are significantly more inclined to cast a blank or invalid vote. Second, distrust is positively associated with a preference for extreme right (Vlaams Belang) and populist (Lijst Dedecker) parties. Third, in party systems where there is no supply of viable challengers (i.e. the French-speaking region of Belgium), the effect of political trust on party preference is limited.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trust and Elections;,citation_abstract=Political trust is closely related to various forms of electoral behavior. First, political trust tends to stimulate voter turnout, as distrusting citizens are less motivated to cast a vote. Second, low levels of political trust have been associated with an anti-incumbent vote and with populist voting. Third, taking part in elections can actually boost levels of political trust, although it is debatable whether this effect is limited to supporters of the winning party in elections. The occurrence of this winner-loser gap, however, seems to depend strongly on specific characteristics of electoral and party systems. Across liberal democracies, processes of electoral dealignment have led to lower levels of voter turnout and a higher vote share for populist parties. To a large extent, it remains to be investigated what causal role political trust plays in these processes.;,citation_author=Marc Hooghe;,citation_editor=Eric M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trust in the Count: Improving Voter Confidence with Post-election Audits;,citation_abstract=Post-election audits are thought to bolster voter confidence in elections, but it is unclear which aspects of audits drive public trust. Using preregistered vignette and conjoint survey experiments administered by YouGov on a sample of 2,000 American respondents, we find that how an audit is conducted is more important than what an audit finds. Structural features of audits, like who conducts it and how its results are announced, turn out to be more consequential to voter evaluations of election results than the actual discrepancy found. Moreover, while Democrats and Republicans have increasingly divided views of the state of democracy in the United States, they are similarly receptive to information presented about audits and largely agree that audits are effective tools for detecting errors in vote counting. Our findings thus reinforce the expectation that audits do increase voter trust and highlight that election administrators can strengthen voter confidence by making audits as transparent as possible.;,citation_author=Jacob Jaffe;,citation_author=Joseph R Loffredo;,citation_author=Samuel Baltz;,citation_author=Alejandro Flores;,citation_author=Charles Stewart;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae029;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Radicalization in the Ranks: An Assessment of the Scope and Nature of Criminal Extremism in the United States Military;,citation_abstract=This project expands the Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the United States (PIRUS) database with information on the nexus of criminal extremism and U.S. military service. The expanded database includes 461 individuals with U.S. military backgrounds who committed criminal acts in the United States from 1990 through 2021 that were motivated by their political, economic, social, or religious goals. The first section explores the scope and nature of criminal extremism in the ranks, detailing the rates of military service among criminal extremists and analyzing their military branch, ideological, and extremist group affiliations. This section also provides a closer look at the individuals with military backgrounds who have been charged with criminal offenses related to the Capitol breach of January 6, 2021. Section two provides a closer look at risk factors for radicalization, comparing subjects with military backgrounds to those without records of military service. This section explores the rates of substance use disorders, anti-social relationships, and social mobility challenges among past U.S. service members who committed extremist crimes and situates these radicalization risk factors within the larger extremist context in the United States. The final section of results examines the risk factors and vulnerabilities for radicalization that are unique to subgroups of criminal extremists with U.S. military backgrounds. Using hierarchical clustering methods, the results in this section show how the radicalization pathways of extremists with military backgrounds are likely to differ depending on whether individuals are active in the military at the time of their involvement in extremism or if they have military-specific risk factors for radicalization, such as previous deployments to combat zones or diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This report concludes with recommendations for policy and future research, paying particular attention to the potential benefits of applying a public health model to countering the spread of extremism in the U.S. military.;,citation_author=Michael Jensen;,citation_author=Elizabeth Yates;,citation_author=Sheehan Kane;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/Radicalization%20in%20the%20Ranks_April%202022.pdf;,citation_technical_report_institution=National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START): College Park;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Global Crisis of Trust in Elections;,citation_abstract=This article introduces a special issue on trust in elections. While the number of electoral democracies has grown globally, we are currently experiencing a crisis of electoral trust. Political polarization, social divisions, and the rapid spread of misinformation have all been related to enhanced widespread skepticism about the quality of national elections. The special issue is focused on two central questions: How can we explain variations in trust in elections at the individual and country levels? How does trust in elections shape political behavior? In the introduction essay, we frame the contributions of the special issue, provide descriptive statistics about trust in elections globally, summarize the current state of the literature, and point to avenues for future research.;,citation_author=Nicholas Kerr;,citation_author=Bridgett A King;,citation_author=Michael Wahman;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae016;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Where Are the Sore Losers? Competitive Authoritarianism, Incumbent Defeat, and Electoral Trust in Zambiaâs 2021 Election;,citation_abstract=How do electoral turnovers shape citizen perceptions of election quality in competitive authoritarian regimes? We argue that electoral outcomes are crucial for determining perceptions of electoral quality. While detailed evaluation of electoral trust is complex in competitive autocracies with institutional uncertainty and polarized electoral environments, turnovers send strong and unequivocal signals about election quality. Previous literature has noted a strong partisan divide in electoral trust in competitive authoritarian regimes, but turnovers can boost trust among both incumbent and opposition supporters. We test this argument in the case of Zambiaâs 2021 election, a case where a ruling party lost despite electoral manipulation and strong control over the Election Management Body (EMB). Empirically, we leverage the first-ever panel survey carried out during Zambian elections. Comparing trust in elections before and after the election, we find that perceived election quality increased after the 2021 electoral turnover among both losers and winners. We find that trust in elections increased the most among winning opposition supporters. Moreover, despite the outgoing presidentâs attempt to portray the election as fraudulent, losing ruling-party supporters also increased their trust in elections after the turnover. The study has important implications for the literature on democratic consolidation and institutional trust.;,citation_author=Nicholas Kerr;,citation_author=Matthias KrÃ¶nke;,citation_author=Michael Wahman;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae030;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">

Our analysis of a stratified sample of 151 articles featuring veterans from either the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan finds that the media frames veterans as damaged by their service but deserving of government benefits and social assistance. When the media frames veterans as actively engaging in society, their social engagement is often because of or despite their injuries or mistreatment. We find interplay between victimization and deservingness such that depictions of the cohort as physically and mentally damaged complement and justify arguments for a sustained high level of benefits to accommodate the needs of veterans. We thus argue that generous benefits for veterans partly stem from their depiction as having suffered from their service.;,citation_author=Meredith Kleykamp;,citation_author=Crosby Hipes;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1111/socf.12166;,citation_issn=1573-7861;,citation_volume=30;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Sociological Forum;">

This study evaluates public support for social engagement with veterans and spending on recent military veteransâ health care and estimates the extent of socially desirable reporting on these forms of support. It uses a list experiment to identify the extent of socially desirable reporting on topics. Findings demonstrate that the public offers overwhelming support for spending on veteransâ health care and social engagement with the group, but they somewhat overstate this support. Support differs by age, race, and political ideology, and social desirability bias varies by race, political ideology, and prior military experience. African Americans express the lowest levels of support for returning veterans and the greatest extent of socially desirable reporting on that support.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does Exposure to Election Fraud Research Undermine Confidence in Elections?;,citation_abstract=Can academic research on election fraud undermine public confidence in elections? As election results become instantaneously accessible all over the world, academic research can increasingly influence perceptions of election integrity. To examine how electoral fraud information from academic research can affect votersâ beliefs about the legitimacy of election results, we conducted a survey experiment following the 2020 general election in South Korea. Using a nationally representative sample of Korean voters and exploiting a unique real-world situation featuring foreign academics considered relatively impartial, we found that exposure to hypothetical election fraud claims undermined confidence in electoral outcomes, measured via both self-reports and behavioral measures. Moreover, the claimsâ impact was conditional on votersâ partisan attachmentsâstrongest among supporters of the losing partyâwhich is in line with the logic of motivated reasoning.

We argue that it has. Those who believe Trumpâs claim, whom we call election skeptics, lack confidence in elections for two interrelated reasons. First, because they think 2020 was inaccurately and unfairly conducted, they think that other elections will suffer a similar fate, and hence think these elections are illegitimate even before any votes are cast. Second, while most voters think elections are less legitimate when their preferred candidate loses, this effect will be especially large for election skeptics, because voter fraud gives them a mechanism to explain their candidateâs loss. Using an original panel dataset spanning the 2020 and 2022 elections, we show strong support for these hypotheses.

Using data from a nationally representative survey that incorporates an experimental design, we assess the extent to which attitudes toward military veterans and private contractors differ, and whether public attitudes toward men vary based on combat and war zone experience. Drawing on social psychology and military sociology, we test hypotheses derived from a conceptual model of stigma and from research on the cultural injunction to âsupport the troops.â Consistent with the first portion of the stigma model, members of the public are not surprised to learn that men who went to a war zone behave according to stereotypes that imply that such men have problems with mental health, substance abuse, and violent behavior. Yet they do not discriminate against these men. Instead they favor men who went to Iraq compared to those who stayed in the United States. They also favor veterans compared to contractors. While combat veterans may be stereotyped, they are not stigmatized.

We conducted a survey with over 6000 likely voters during the primaries. We included a priming experiment that manipulated the salience of Buttigiegâs identity traits. We then asked respondents how much they liked Buttigieg and who they would support in a match-up between Buttigieg and Trump. Overall, voters penalized Buttigieg for being in a same-sex relationship. The penalty surprisingly increased when his religiosity was highlighted. In contrast, Buttigiegâs military background mitigated voter discrimination when he was presented as a veteran married to a man.

In addition, between 2000 and 2009 the gender-based wage gap for nonveterans decreased while the gap between the pay of the reference group and male and female veterans grew for federal employees who did not work for the DOD. In the same years, for DOD employees there are fewer differences in pay based on veteran status and gender and race.

Evidence suggests the general public holds conflicting attitudes toward veterans. This study examines how perceived public attitudes play a role in veteransâ mental health and well-being. Drawing from and extending interactionist theories of self-concept, stigma, and mental health recovery, we develop and estimate models for the relationships between internalized public attitudes toward veterans (perceived public regard), military identityârelated self-worth (private regard), and well-being (depression, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction). Using survey data from the Chicagoland Veterans Study, we found that perceived public regard is negatively related to depression and positively related to self-efficacy and life satisfaction. The relationship between public regard and self-efficacy is fully mediated by private regard, and a significant part of the relationship between perceived public regard and both depression and life satisfaction is mediated by private regard. The study suggests avenues for extending theory and research related to military identity and public understanding of veterans as well as other groups where there may be conflicting public sentiment toward them.;,citation_author=Fred E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Thinking twice about sum scores;,citation_abstract=A common way to form scores from multiple-item scales is to sum responses of all items. Though sum scoring is often contrasted with factor analysis as a competing method, we review how factor analysis and sum scoring both fall under the larger umbrella of latent variable models, with sum scoring being a constrained version of a factor analysis. Despite similarities, reporting of psychometric properties for sum scored or factor analyzed scales are quite different. Further, if researchers use factor analysis to validate a scale but subsequently sum score the scale, this employs a model that differs from validation model. By framing sum scoring within a latent variable framework, our goal is to raise awareness that (a) sum scoring requires rather strict constraints, (b) imposing these constraints requires the same type of justification as any other latent variable model, and (c) sum scoring corresponds to a statistical model and is not a model-free arithmetic calculation. We discuss how unjustified sum scoring can have adverse effects on validity, reliability, and qualitative classification from sum score cut-offs. We also discuss considerations for how to use scale scores in subsequent analyses and how these choices can alter conclusions. The general goal is to encourage researchers to more critically evaluate how they obtain, justify, and use multiple-item scale scores.;,citation_author=Daniel McNeish;,citation_author=Melissa Gordon Wolf;,citation_publication_date=2020-12-01;,citation_cover_date=2020-12-01;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.3758/s13428-020-01398-0;,citation_issn=1554-3528;,citation_volume=52;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Behavior Research Methods;,citation_journal_abbrev=Behav Res;">

My response begins with a review of the literature supporting the perspective we adopted in the original article. I then conduct simulation studies to assess the psychometric properties of sum scores created using Widaman and Revelleâs justification relative to scores created by the weighted factor score approach in the original article. In my simulations, I generate data where sum and factor scores are correlated at 0.96 or 0.98 because high factorâsum score correlations are often used to support the contention that sum and factor scores have interchangeable psychometric properties. I explore (a) correlations between estimated scores and true scores, (b) classification accuracy of sum and factor scores, and (c) reliability of sum and factor scores. Results show that factor scores have (a) higher correlations with true scores ($\Delta$ = 0.02â0.04), (b) higher sensitivity ($\Delta$ = 4â8 percentage points), and (c) higher reliability ($\Delta$ = 0.04â0.07). Factor score performance metrics also have less sampling variability in most conditions. Psychometric properties of sum scoresâeven when highly correlated with factor scoresâremain less desirable than those of factor scores. Additional considerations like models with multiple factors and measurement invariance are also discussed. Essentially, even if accepting Widaman and Revelleâs justification for sum scoring, it is uncertain whether researchers generally would want to sum score after fitting a factor analysis unless sum and factor scores correlate at (and not merely close to) 1.00.;,citation_author=Daniel McNeish;,citation_publication_date=2023-12-01;,citation_cover_date=2023-12-01;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.3758/s13428-022-02016-x;,citation_issn=1554-3528;,citation_volume=55;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Behavior Research Methods;,citation_journal_abbrev=Behav Res;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Critical Citizens : Global Support for Democratic Government;,citation_abstract=Critical Citizens: Global Support for Democratic Government analyses a series of interrelated questions. The first two are diagnostic: how far are there legitimate grounds for concern about public support for democracy world-wide? Are trends towards growing cynicism evident in the United States evident in many established and newer democracies? The second concern is analytical: what are the main political, economic, and cultural factors driving the dynamics of support for democratic government? The final questions are prescriptive: what are the consequences of this analysis and what are the implications for strengthening democratic governance? This book has brought together a distinguished group of international scholars who develop a global analysis of these issues that looks at trends in establishes and newer democracies as we approach the end of the twentieth century. It also presents the first results of the 1995-7 World Values Study as well as drawing on an extensive range of comparative empirical evidence. Challenging the conventional wisdom, this original and stimulating book concludes that accounts of a democratic âcrisisâare greatly exaggerated. By the mid-1990s most citizens world-wide shared widespread aspirations to the ideals and principles of democratic government. At the same time there remains a marked gap between evaluations of the ideal and the practice of democracy. The public in many newer democracies in Central and Eastern Europe and in Latin America proved deeply critical of the performance of their governing regimes. And in many established democracies the 1980s saw a decline in public confidence in the core institutions of representative democracy including parliaments, the legal system, and political parties. The book considers the causes and consequences of the development of critical citizens. It will prove invaluable for those interested in comparative politics, public opinion, and the dynamics of the democratization process. ADVANCE PRAISE âThe great democratic paradox of the 1990s is that it has simultaneously been the decade of democratization and the decade of growing distrust of democratic institutions. This volume admirably dissects the complex and multi-dimensional background of these conflicting trends, and presents a judicious evaluation of the grounds of optimism and pessimismâin which, fortunately, the former prevails.âAREND LIJPHART, University of California San Diego âCritical Citizens is the most comprehensive collection of comparative work on confidence in government and sources of public support for democracy.

They sort out the rather high degree of support for democracy from widespread uneasiness with the workings of instituions and with the behaviour of politicians. Their book is must reading for survey researchers and comparative students of democracy alike.âSIDNEY TARROW, Cornell University âThis is the most impressive comparative study of how citizens in contemporay democracies relate to their governments.

With US military veterans playing a central role in the assault on the US Capitol, answering this question is of immediate scholarly and policy concern. To better understand the impact of military service, we conducted the first nationally representative survey of support for pro-Trump anti-democratic violence (âinsurrectionist sentimentsâ) among US military veterans and a demographically matched sample of non-veterans. Our analysis finds veterans nearly twice as likely to hold high insurrectionist sentiments than non-veterans, and that military service increases support for restoring Trump to the presidency by force by 15 percent. Further, we find the effect veterancy is not fully explained by veterans being more likely to hold pro-Trump or conspiracy beliefs but is associated with negative military and post-service-related experiences. These findings are robust to significant unobserved confounding. We conclude with implications for future research on political violence and the role of the military in American democracy.;,citation_author=Robert A. Pape;,citation_author=Keven G.

Frequently, variables (i.e., items or indicators) resulting from questionnaires using ordinal items with 2â7 categories are used. There are plenty of articles that recommend treating ordinal variables in a factor analysis by default as ordinal and not as continuous imposing a multivariate normal distribution assumption. In this article, we exhibit that the reasoning behind such suggestions is flawed. In our view, findings from simulation studies cannot tell about the right modeling strategy of ordinal variables in factor analysis. Moreover, it is argued that ordinal factor models impose a normality assumption for underlying continuous variables, which might also often be incorrect in empirical applications. However, researchers seldom opt for more flexible modeling strategies that involve correctly specified distributions.

First, our measure asks directly about the counting of votes, rather than broader democratic processes. Second, we control for endogeneity by comparing the same respondents pre- and post-election, and by comparing respondents whose preferred candidate barely won to those whose candidate barely lost. Third, we reveal previously unknown within-country variation in this effect.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Conspiracy Beliefs and Perceptions of Electoral Integrity: Cross-National Evidence from 29 Countries;,citation_abstract=Extant research shows that belief in conspiracy theories and conspiratorial thinking are negatively related to citizensâ perceptions about the fairness and integrity of elections. However, by exclusively focusing on the United States as only one important empirical case, previous studies have left unanswered crucial questions on the scope, generalizability, and context dependency of their empirical findings. In this research note, I aim to fill this void by providing first empirical evidence on the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and electoral-integrity perceptions across twenty-nine countries. Using high-quality individual-level data from the European Social Survey enriched with contextual-level data on the quality of elections taken from the Varieties of Democracy Project, the findings from linear mixed-effects regression models reveal that (1) conspiracy beliefs are negatively related to citizensâ evaluations concerning the integrity of national elections; (2) the specific strength of the observed individual-level relationship varies substantially across countries; and (3) the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and individual electoral-integrity perceptions depends on the contextual-level quality and integrity of elections across countries. Specifically, the results indicate that the negative relationship between conspiracy beliefs and electoral-integrity perceptions is strongest in contexts in which the actual quality of elections is high, and in which citizens have little reason to (seriously) doubt the integrity of the electoral process. These findings provide an important and hitherto missing cross-national and multilevel perspective on the nexus between individual conspiracy beliefs and electoral-integrity perceptions, highlighting that the âconspiratorial challengeâ to electoral legitimacy in contemporary democracies is real and more than an âAmerican affliction.â;,citation_author=Christian Schnaudt;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae027;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Limits of Electoral Reform;,citation_abstract=Institutionsâmatterâto electoral reform advocates and political scientists - both argue that variation in electoral institutions affect how elected officials and citizens behave. Change the rules, and citizen engagement with politics can be renewed. Yet a look at the record of electoral reform reveals a string of disappointments. This book examines a variety of reforms, including campaign finance, direct democracy, legislative term limits, and changes to the electoral system itself. This study finds electoral reforms have limited, and in many cases, no effects. Despite reform advocatesâclaims, and contrary to theâinstitutions matterâliterature, findings here suggest there are hard limits to effects of electoral reform. The explanations for this are threefold. The first is political. Reformers exaggerate claims about transformative effects of new electoral rules, yet their goal may simply be to maximize their partisan advantage. The second is empirical. Cross-sectional comparative research demonstrates that variation in electoral institutions corresponds with different patterns of political attitudes and behaviour. But this method cannot assess what happens when rules are changed. Using examples from the US, UK, New Zealand, Australia, and elsewhere this book examines attitudes and behaviour across time where rules were changed. Results do not match expectations from the institutional literature. Third is a point of logic. There is an inflated sense of the effects of institutions generally, and of electoral institutions in particular. Given the larger social and economic forces at play, it is unrealistic to expect that changes in electoral arrangements will have substantial effects on political engagement or on how people view politics and politicians. Institutional reform is an almost constant part of the political agenda in democratic societies. Someone, somewhere, always has a proposal not just to change the workings of the system but to reform it. The book is about how and why such reforms disappoint.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trust in Elections;,citation_abstract=The sometimes violent movement to reject the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election draws our attention to the topic of trust in the institution of American election administration. An examination of this topic must make an important distinction between trust in elections (a psychological construct) and the trustworthiness of election results (a legal construct). The history of election administration in the United States is full of examples of efforts to increase the trustworthiness of elections to ensure that results are based on fair and competent administration. The resilience of these efforts was on display following the 2020 election, as formal institutions rejected claims that the election was fraudulent. Still, the past two decades have seen a decline in trust in American elections that has primarily been driven by a slow but steady decline in trust among Republicans. Surprisingly, the increased polarization in trust most recently has been due more to Democrats suddenly becoming more trusting. Election officials must continue to try to overcome attacks on trust in the system, but it is unclear how long they can sustain the legal system guaranteeing free and fair elections without broad-based public trust in how we administer elections.;,citation_author=Charles Stewart;,citation_publication_date=2022-11-15;,citation_cover_date=2022-11-15;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1162/daed_a_01953;,citation_issn=0011-5266;,citation_volume=151;,citation_journal_title=Daedalus;,citation_journal_abbrev=Daedalus;">

Using an experimental design, we randomly assign candidate characteristics of veteran status and gender, and we observe HR directorsâ assessments of candidate preparedness.

At the same time, the results are less conclusive when compared to similar public sector experiences.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Your Typical Criminal: Why White Americans Hate Voter Fraud;,citation_abstract=Public concerns about voter fraud are widespread and are frequently cited to justify new voting restrictions and harsh punishment for violators. But to what extent do beliefs about a perpetratorâs identity shape public support for efforts to prevent and punish voter fraud? Antipathy toward racial and ethnic groups is a strong predictor of public beliefs about voter fraud. Yet, prior studies have only been able to approximate beliefs about deviant behavior, and not specifically casting an illegal ballot. Drawing from sociology and criminology, we use a âtypificationâ strategy that more directly measures which people are perceived as typical perpetrators of casting illegal ballots. We utilize nationally representative surveys of US voters in the 2017â2020 modules of the Cooperative Election Study to apply and empirically test the typification theory. Among white respondents, we find that the typification of racially minoritized groups such as Blacks, Latinos, Arabs, and immigrants as illegal voters is widespread and is strongly associated with beliefs about voter fraud, support for restrictive election policies, and harsh punishment of illegal voting. The pictures of likely criminals that white voters carry in their heads shape their preferences for crime policies, and this extends to the domain of voter fraud.;,citation_author=Adriano Udani;,citation_author=Anita Manion;,citation_author=David Kimball;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae023;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Affective stimulus properties influence size perception and the Ebbinghaus illusion;,citation_abstract=In the New Look literature of the 1950s, it has been suggested that size judgments are dependent on the affective content of stimuli. This suggestion, however, has been âdiscreditedâ due to contradictory findings and methodological problems. In the present study, we revisited this forgotten issue in two experiments. The first experiment investigated the influence of affective content on size perception by examining judgments of the size of target circles with and without affectively loaded (i.e., positive, neutral, and negative) pictures. Circles with a picture were estimated to be smaller than circles without a picture, and circles with a negative picture were estimated to be larger than circles with a positive or a neutral picture confirming the suggestion from the 1950s that size perception is influenced by affective content, an effect notably confined to negatively loaded stimuli. In a second experiment, we examined whether affective content influenced the Ebbinghaus illusion. Participants judged the size of a target circle whereby target and flanker circles differed in affective loading. The results replicated the first experiment. Additionally, the Ebbinghaus illusion was shown to be weakest for a negatively loaded target with positively loaded and blank flankers.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Matter of Misunderstanding? Explaining (Mis)Perceptions of Electoral Integrity across 25 Different Nations;,citation_abstract=In this paper, we investigate how trust in traditional and social media correlate with misperceptions of electoral integrity. Relying on insights from political communication research on exposure to misinformation and selective exposure mechanisms, as well as insights on the different roles of traditional and social media in different regime types, we argue that misperceptions of election integrity are likely driven in large part by the interplay between the trust people have in different media sources and the context (i.e., the level of press freedom) in which the elections take place. Using data from a survey conducted in 25 countries across the world, we find that trust in information from traditional media decreases misperceptions, while trust in information from social media increases misperceptions. However, both these effects are smaller when press freedom is restricted. In countries with low levels of press freedom, trust in social media is even associated with lower levels of misperceptions.;,citation_author=Rens Vliegenthart;,citation_author=Carolien Van Ham;,citation_author=Sanne Kruikemeier;,citation_author=Kristof Jacobs;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae021;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Common Fallacies in Quantitative Research Methodology;,citation_abstract=Since the inception of scientific revolutions, quantitative research methodology has dominated the research literatures in many disciplines. Despite its long tradition in evidence-based research and practice, many fallacies and misconceptions continue to infiltrate the ways quantitative researchers conceive, collect, analyze, and interpret data. This chapter outlines 16 common fallacies and examines in depth 6 of those that are most consequential and prevalent in published quantitative research. The six major fallacies include Contextual Variable Fallacies, Measurement Error Fallacies, Missing Data Fallacies, Significance Testing Fallacies, Statistical Power Fallacies, and Factor Analysis Fallacies. These fallacies span the entire quantitative research processâfrom research design, sampling, and instrumentation to statistical analysis and interpretation. By drawing implications from recent advances in quantitative methodological research, this chapter examines the theoretical frameworks of those fallacies, traces their origins and developments in applied research, and provides recommendations to address the challenge of alternative solutions. We conclude with a checklist for quantitative researchers to guard against committing those and other common fallacies. Directions for future research in advancing quantitative methodology and recommendations for strategies to correct fallacious practices are also discussed.;,citation_author=Lihshing Leigh Wang;,citation_author=Amber S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Slant, Extremity, and Diversity: How the Shape of News Use Explains Electoral Judgments and Confidence;,citation_abstract=The 2020 election and its aftermath present an opportunity to understand how audiencesâ changing news consumption patterns within an expanded, digitized, and polarized media environment shape electoral judgments. This paper introduces measures that capture individualsâ partisan slant, partisan extremity, and overall diversity of news media use to understand how people interact with the contemporary news ecology. The measures combine self-reported media use with the partisan slant of news outlets along the ideological spectrum. Using these measures, we analyze a two-wave panel survey conducted before and after the 2020 US election to investigate how slant, diversity, and extremity are related to post-election beliefs, including public confidence in the election and the acceptance of fraud claims. Our findings show that Republicans have more insulated news use behaviors in terms of slant and diversity. The analysis also reveals that the slant of peopleâs news use is associated with post-election fraud beliefs, with right-wing news consumers more likely to believe such claims. However, a diverse news consumption style can moderate misinformation beliefs. Panel analysis points to the role of extreme-right news use in decreasing confidence in the legitimacy of the election.;,citation_author=Yiming Wang;,citation_author=Sang Jung Kim;,citation_author=Yuanliang Shan;,citation_author=Yibing Sun;,citation_author=Xiaoya Jiang;,citation_author=Heysung Lee;,citation_author=Porismita Borah;,citation_author=Michael Wagner;,citation_author=Dhavan Shah;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae031;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Thinking thrice about sum scores, and then some more about measurement and analysis;,citation_abstract=Measurement is fundamental to all research in psychology and should be accorded greater scrutiny than typically occurs. Among other claims, McNeish and Wolf (Thinking twice about sum scores. Behavior Research Methods, 52, 2287-2305) argued that use of sum scores (a) implies that a highly constrained latent variable model underlies items comprising a scale, and (b) may misrepresent or bias relations with other criteria. The central claim by McNeish and Wolf that use of sum scores requires the assumption that a parallel test model underlies item responses is incorrect and without psychometric merit. Instead, if a set of items is unidimensional, estimators of reliability are available even if the factor model underlying the set of items does not have a highly constrained form. Thus, dimensionality of a set of items is the key issue, and whether strict constraints on parameter estimates do or do not hold dictate the appropriate way to estimate reliability. McNeish and Wolf also claimed that more precise forms of scoring, such as estimating factor scores, would be preferable to sum scores. We provide analytic bases for reliability estimation and then provide several demonstrations of reliability estimation and the relative advantages of sum scores and factor scores. We contend that several claims by McNeish and Wolf are questionable and that, as a result, multiple recommendations they made and conclusions they drew are incorrect. The upshot is that, once the dimensional structure of a set of items is verified, sum scores often have a solid psychometric basis and therefore are frequently quite adequate for psychological research.;,citation_author=Keith F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Thinking About Sum Scores Yet Again, Maybe the Last Time, We Donât Know, Oh No . . .: A Comment on;,citation_abstract=The relative advantages and disadvantages of sum scores and estimated factor scores are issues of concern for substantive research in psychology. Recently, while championing estimated factor scores over sum scores, McNeish offered a trenchant rejoinder to an article by Widaman and Revelle, which had critiqued an earlier paper by McNeish and Wolf. In the recent contribution, McNeish misrepresented a number of claims by Widaman and Revelle, rendering moot his criticisms of Widaman and Revelle. Notably, McNeish chose to avoid confronting a key strength of sum scores stressed by Widaman and Revelleâthe greater comparability of results across studies if sum scores are used. Instead, McNeish pivoted to present a host of simulation studies to identify relative strengths of estimated factor scores. Here, we review our prior claims and, in the process, deflect purported criticisms by McNeish. We discuss briefly issues related to simulated data and empirical data that provide evidence of strengths of each type of score. In doing so, we identified a second strength of sum scores: superior cross-validation of results across independent samples of empirical data, at least for samples of moderate size. We close with consideration of four general issues concerning sum scores and estimated factor scores that highlight the contrasts between positions offered by McNeish and by us, issues of importance when pursuing applied research in our field.;,citation_author=Keith F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Trump Effect? Right-Wing Populism and Distrust in Voting by Mail in Canada;,citation_abstract=Do Donald Trumpâs attacks on voting by mail influence how some Canadians view mail-in ballots? The Trump effect on views and behaviors surrounding voting by mail has been well documented in the United States. North of the border, more Canadians than ever voted by mail in the last general election. In this study, we consider how right-wing populism is associated with trust in voting by mail among Canadians. Specifically, we seek to test two main hypotheses. First, we consider whether Canadians holding populist viewsâand, in particular, those holding right-wing populist views (would-be Trump supporters)âare less trusting of voting by mail. Second, we consider whether political media exposure amplifies this association. We analyze data from both the 2021 Canadian Election Study and Democracy Checkup Survey. We find that those who hold populist views clearly have less trust in voting by mail. This is especially true among right-leaning individuals. Furthermore, as in the United States, this effect is moderated by oneâs level of political media exposure, with higher levels of political media exposure amplifying the effect of populist views on trust in voting by mail. Our findings, therefore, suggest that the politicization of mail-in voting by President Trump has important implications for the legitimacy of the electoral system not only in the United States, but also in Canada and potentially in other parts of the world.;,citation_author=Cary Wu;,citation_author=Andrew Dawson;,citation_publication_date=2024-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-08-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/poq/nfae020;,citation_issn=1537-5331;,citation_volume=88;,citation_journal_title=Public Opinion Quarterly;,citation_journal_abbrev=Public Opinion Quarterly;">

In Study 2, the authors manipulated identity threat among people affiliated (or not) with New York University (NYU). When Columbia University was portrayed as threatening to NYU, NYU affiliates estimated Columbia as closer than did non-affiliates, compared with when Columbia was nonthreatening. In Study 3, Americans who perceived more symbolic threats from Mexican immigration estimated Mexico City as closer. Collective identification with the in-group moderated effects of threat on distance estimations.

We propose the perceptual model of intergroup relations to conceptualize how intergroup relations are grounded in perception. We review the growing literature on how intergroup dynamics shape perception across different sensory modalities and argue that these perceptual processes mediate intergroup relations. The model provides a starting point for social psychologists to study perception as a function of social group dynamics and for perception researchers to consider social influences. We highlight several gaps in the literature and outline areas for future research. Uncovering the role of perception in intergroup relations offers novel insights into the construction of shared reality and may help devise new and unique interventions targeted at the perceptual level.;,citation_author=Y.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Proximity under Threat: The Role of Physical Distance in Intergroup Relations;,citation_abstract=Throughout human history, social groups have invested immense amounts of wealth and time to keep threatening out-groups at a distance. In the current research, we explored the relationship between intergroup threat, physical distance, and discrimination. Specifically, we examined how intergroup threat alters estimates of physical distance to out-groups and how physical proximity affects intergroup relations. Previous research has found that people judge threatening out-groups as physically close. In Studies 1 and 2, we examined ways to attenuate this bias. In Study 1 a secure (vs. permeable) US-Mexico border reduced the estimated proximity to Mexico City among Americans who felt threatened by Mexican immigration. In Study 2, intergroup apologies reduced estimates of physical proximity to a threatening cross-town rival university, but only among participants with cross-group friendships. In Study 3, New York Yankees fans who received an experimental induction of physical proximity to a threatening out-group (Boston Red Sox) had a stronger relationship between their collective identification with the New York Yankees and support for discriminatory policies toward members of the out-group (Red Sox fans) as well as how far they chose to sit from out-group members (Red Sox fans). Together, these studies suggest that intergroup threat alters judgment of physical properties, which has important implications for intergroup relations.;,citation_author=Y.

A small body of literature suggests that veterans prefer to work with providers or peer support specialists who are also veterans. Research with trauma-exposed veterans suggests that some veterans prefer to work with female providers. In an experimental study with 414 veterans, we examined whether veteransâ ratings of a psychologist (e.g., helpfulness, ability to understand the participant, likelihood of making an appointment) described in a vignette were impacted by the psychologistâs veteran status and gender. Results indicated that veterans who read about a veteran psychologist rated the psychologist as more able to help and understand them, reported being more willing to see and more comfortable seeing the psychologist, and reported greater belief that they should see the psychologist, relative to those who read about a non-veteran psychologist. Contrary to hypotheses, there was no main effect of psychologist gender nor any interaction between psychologist gender and psychologist veteran status on ratings. Findings suggest that having access to mental health providers who are also veterans may reduce barriers to treatment-seeking among veteran patients.;,citation_author=Julie D.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Election administration officials make efforts to sustain public trust and confidence in the fairness and accuracy of elections, and attempt to boost such confidence where it may be deprived. Concerns for safety have developed among election staff and voters in more recent elections. Regular measures are taken to enhance the <em>trustworthiness</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> of the electoral process through practices meant to improve the conduct, transparency, or overall administration of elections in the United States.</p>
<p>Although election officials undertake great efforts to enhance the trustworthiness of election administration, public <em>trust</em> in elections is a psychological construct influenced by many things outside of election official control such as partisanship or elite rhetoric <span class="citation" data-cites="hooghe2018 sances2015">(<a href="#ref-hooghe2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hooghe 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-sances2015" role="doc-biblioref">Sances and Stewart 2015</a>)</span>. Moreover, a personâs evaluation of the election in hindsight is often influenced by the election outcome itself <span class="citation" data-cites="daniller2019 stewart2022">(<a href="#ref-daniller2019" role="doc-biblioref">Daniller and Mutz 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-stewart2022" role="doc-biblioref">Stewart 2022</a>)</span>. Thus, measures taken by election officials can be undermined, trivialized, or made irrelevant depending on how one feels after the election results have come out.</p>
<p>Such volatile attitudes and evaluations post-election can leave a lasting impression that election officials must contend with upon the next election cycle <span class="citation" data-cites="levendusky2024 bowler2024">(<a href="#ref-bowler2024" role="doc-biblioref">Bowler and Donovan 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-levendusky2024" role="doc-biblioref">Levendusky et al. 2024</a>)</span>. For instance, we have witnessed many peopleâs outright refusal to accept the 2020 U.S. election results as legitimate despite consistent review of the evidence confirming the results as fair and accurate. Such a case demonstrates that public trust in elections is, at best, only partial to trustworthiness of election administration in the United States<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>One point of contention that election officials have faced in the past regard evaluation of election workers. Previous literature has focused on how voter interaction with election workers <span class="citation" data-cites="claassen2008">(<a href="#ref-claassen2008" role="doc-biblioref">Claassen et al. 2008</a>)</span>, voting technology <span class="citation" data-cites="herrnson2009">(<a href="#ref-herrnson2009" role="doc-biblioref">Herrnson, Niemi, and Hanmer 2009</a>)</span>, and the voter experience generally <span class="citation" data-cites="atkeson2007">(<a href="#ref-atkeson2007" role="doc-biblioref">Atkeson and Saunders 2007</a>)</span>, influences evaluations of election administration. As such, election worker competency has been examined as a factor significant to evaluations of performance of elections <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2007 hall2009">(<a href="#ref-hall2007" role="doc-biblioref">T. Hall, Monson, and Patterson 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-hall2009" role="doc-biblioref">T. E. Hall, Quin Monson, and Patterson 2009</a>)</span>. However, considering that individual perceptions and preconceived notions play a huge role in cognition <span class="citation" data-cites="cikara2014 vanbavel2021">(<a href="#ref-cikara2014" role="doc-biblioref">Cikara and Bavel 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-vanbavel2021" role="doc-biblioref">Van Bavel and Packer 2021</a>)</span>, it is reasonable to expect that the group an election worker hails from would be an important influence upon the voterâs evaluation of the electoral process.</p>
<p>Supposing such is the case, we can expect that information about <em>who</em> (i.e., which groups) election officials are targeting in publicized recruitment efforts would lessen particular election insecurity, and concurrently, boost confidence. That is to say, it is reasonable to expect that telling people <em>who</em> will be working and volunteering as election staff would ease election insecurity, and therefore improve confidence that the election will be conducted fairly, accurately, and safe for all involved.</p>
<p>In this paper, I report results from a recent survey experiment administered to test whether publicized efforts to recruit veterans to work as election staff and volunteers would improve public trust in elections and ease election insecurity. Results of the survey experiment support the notion that emphasizing veterans as the target of election worker recruitment efforts eases pre-election insecurity. Expectations of electoral fraud and concerns for voter safety were lower among those who read an announcement that veterans are being recruited to work as election staff and volunteers compared to those who read a control vignette where veterans were not mentioned<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. Notable is that there was a significant difference in confidence among those in the treatment condition who believe that results of the 2020 election were illegitimate.</p>
<p>This paper is structured as follows. First, I provide a brief background on public trust in election administration. I synthesize a review of relevant literature with a focus on how political and social science has conceptualized and ascertained public trust in elections. Next, I supply reasoning for why military veterans are singled out as the relevant subset of the population in this study. I then explicitly provide the simple theory and testable hypotheses of the study before moving on to describe the design of the survey, the measurement instruments therein, and the conceptual and operational definitions of the variables of interest. I explain my reasoning and method for constructing the primary dependent variable, which I broadly refer to as <em>confidence in elections</em>. I close by offering my interpretation of the results and suggest potential avenues for future inquiry.</p>

<section id="background-election-administration-and-public-confidence" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background-election-administration-and-public-confidence">Background: Election Administration and Public Confidence</h2>
<p>Election officials have tried hard to inspire confidence in the administration and conduct of elections by improving the degree to which elections are trustworthy. Development and implementation of procedures such as post-election auditing of ballots and logic-and-accuracy testing of ballot tabulation equipment are prominent examples adding to the long history of efforts to enhance the trustworthiness of election administration in the United States.</p>
<p>Prior to the year 2000, one of the main issues facing election administration was recruiting enough election workers to volunteer at the polls (i.e., poll workers) <span class="citation" data-cites="maidenberg1996">(<a href="#ref-maidenberg1996" role="doc-biblioref">Maidenberg 1996</a>)</span>. Election worker recruitment is still much of an issue in the current era as it was then, perhaps worse <span class="citation" data-cites="ferrer2024">(<a href="#ref-ferrer2024" role="doc-biblioref">Ferrer, Thompson, and Orey 2024</a>)</span>. In addition to ensuring election offices were adequately staffed, the controversy of the 2000 general election made the public more attentive to issues concerning the conduct and administration of elections. In particular, voting technology <span class="citation" data-cites="herrnson2009">(<a href="#ref-herrnson2009" role="doc-biblioref">Herrnson, Niemi, and Hanmer 2009</a>)</span> and election worker competence was of interest in election studies <span class="citation" data-cites="claassen2008 hall2009 hall2007">(<a href="#ref-claassen2008" role="doc-biblioref">Claassen et al. 2008</a>; <a href="#ref-hall2007" role="doc-biblioref">T. Hall, Monson, and Patterson 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-hall2009" role="doc-biblioref">T. E. Hall, Quin Monson, and Patterson 2009</a>)</span>. Following the passage of the Help America Vote Act in 2002, election officials efforts to boost public confidence in the conduct and administration of elections revolved primarily around the accuracy of vote counts, ballot tabulation equipment or voting machines, the commitment of election staff, and more <span class="citation" data-cites="atkeson2007">(<a href="#ref-atkeson2007" role="doc-biblioref">Atkeson and Saunders 2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In 2024, election officials made valiant efforts to boost public confidence elections within an intensified political climate that appeared quite hostile to election officials <span class="citation" data-cites="edlin2024 brennancenterforjustice2024">(<a href="#ref-brennancenterforjustice2024" role="doc-biblioref">Brennan Center for Justice 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-edlin2024" role="doc-biblioref">Edlin and Norden 2024</a>)</span>. Although polling around the time indicated that most people thought that U.S. elections would be run at least somewhat well <span class="citation" data-cites="nadeem2024">(<a href="#ref-nadeem2024" role="doc-biblioref">Nadeem 2024</a>)</span>, many election officials nationwide took efforts to assuage the worry of those most skeptical.</p>
<p>Election anxiety was high in the lead up to the 2024 elections in the United States. Concerns for voter safety and the prospect of political violence remained prescient and compelled many local officials to prepare for the worst <span class="citation" data-cites="edlin2024 doubek2024">(<a href="#ref-doubek2024" role="doc-biblioref">Doubek 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-edlin2024" role="doc-biblioref">Edlin and Norden 2024</a>)</span>. Election officials in Washoe County, Nevada, installed panic buttons for election staff that would alert a monitoring center to summon law enforcement <span class="citation" data-cites="lincoln2024">(<a href="#ref-lincoln2024" role="doc-biblioref">Lincoln 2024</a>)</span>. Nevada also passed a law making it a felony to harass, threaten, or intimidate election workers <span class="citation" data-cites="nevadasecretaryofstate2023">(<a href="#ref-nevadasecretaryofstate2023" role="doc-biblioref">Nevada Secretary of State 2023</a>)</span>. Leading up to election day, news outlets reported that election work had become a seemingly dangerous job <span class="citation" data-cites="wire2024">(<a href="#ref-wire2024" role="doc-biblioref">Wire et al. 2024</a>)</span>. A Brennan Center survey report stated that, ââ¦large numbers of election officials report having experienced threats, abuse, or harassment for doing their jobsâ <span class="citation" data-cites="edlin2024">(<a href="#ref-edlin2024" role="doc-biblioref">Edlin and Norden 2024</a>)</span>. Concerns over the fairness of elections and accuracy of vote counts intensified, heightening concerns over the prospect of political violence and, in turn, increased worry for the safety of voters and election workers alike. Since election worker performance is significant to public evaluation of elections, added safety concerns that drive out election staff and repel volunteers can only detract from trustworthiness of the institution.</p>

<section id="literature-reivew" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="literature-reivew">Literature Reivew</h2>
<p>Trust and confidence in the conduct of elections concerns aspects of elections that fall squarely within the institution of election administration. At this level, for instance, public trust is ascertained by capturing assessments about the perceived accuracy of vote counts (e.g., whether votes are/were counted as intended).</p>
<p>Intuitively, enhancing public trust in elections would best be accomplished by enhancing the <em>trustworthiness</em> of the institution, i.e., consistently doing the things that election officials already regularly do come election time. However, trust and confidence in elections has become ever more precarious over the last few election cycles. Especially considering public polling data since 2000 shows that confidence that votes were, or would be, counted as intended was in a consistent decline despite efforts towards bolstering election integrity and trustworthiness <span class="citation" data-cites="sances2015">(<a href="#ref-sances2015" role="doc-biblioref">Sances and Stewart 2015</a>)</span>. This is even more pronounced considering the role that partisanship has had on such confidence over accuracy of vote count <span class="citation" data-cites="sances2015 stewart2022">(<a href="#ref-sances2015" role="doc-biblioref">Sances and Stewart 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-stewart2022" role="doc-biblioref">Stewart 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Thereâs also stark difference in public trust before the election has occurred compared to after, a phenomenon referred to as the âwinner-loser gapâ; the âwinnersâ are those who supported the winning candidate and the âlosersâ are those who supported the losing candidate. Much research has been dedicated to analyzing the sentiment of electoral winners vs losers, and vice versa <span class="citation" data-cites="nadeau1993 daniller2019">(<a href="#ref-daniller2019" role="doc-biblioref">Daniller and Mutz 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-nadeau1993" role="doc-biblioref">Nadeau and Blais 1993</a>)</span>. Opinions of electoral trust gathered after the election has occurred, however, are limited considering the well-recognized impact that the electoral outcome itself has on feelings of public trust in elections <span class="citation" data-cites="daniller2019">(<a href="#ref-daniller2019" role="doc-biblioref">Daniller and Mutz 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>As such, it is questionable whether we can characterize public trust in the pre-election period as the same trust after the election results have come out. The former is <em>anticipatory</em>âi.e., the kind that is more or less anxious given the uncertainties surrounding the election. The latter is <em>empirical</em>âa judgement discerned in hindsight after the experience of the election event has occurred. As discussed by <span class="citation" data-cites="stewart2022">Stewart (<a href="#ref-stewart2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>, not only was confidence in vote count accuracy influenced by the voter experience, but so too were evaluations of election officials <span class="citation" data-cites="stewart2022">(<a href="#ref-stewart2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022, 242â43</a>)</span>. Not to mention the influence that the election results would also have on such evaluations. In other words, trust evaluations post-election are influenced by oneâs interpretation of their experience and election results. This study, in contrast, focuses primarily on that <em>anticipatory</em> kind of confidence, which speaks more to those insecurities based on perceptions of the institutionâs trustworthiness than upon the particular voter experience.</p>
<p>Regardless of the measures taken by election officials to boost public confidence in the <em>trustworthiness</em> of election administration (e.g., conducting audits, testing election machines), public <em>trust</em> and confidence in elections more generally is apt to shift dramatically post-election based on factors such as partisanship, elite rhetoric, particular state policies, and more <span class="citation" data-cites="nadeau1993 carter2024 coll2024a">(<a href="#ref-carter2024" role="doc-biblioref">Carter et al. 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-coll2024a" role="doc-biblioref">Coll and Clark 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-nadeau1993" role="doc-biblioref">Nadeau and Blais 1993</a>)</span>. Moreover, prior research has found that evaluation of election workers themselves are an important factor when it comes to levels of public confidence in the electoral process <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2007 hall2009 claassen2008">(<a href="#ref-claassen2008" role="doc-biblioref">Claassen et al. 2008</a>; <a href="#ref-hall2007" role="doc-biblioref">T. Hall, Monson, and Patterson 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-hall2009" role="doc-biblioref">T. E. Hall, Quin Monson, and Patterson 2009</a>)</span>. Such studies focused on the quality of the voter experience with reference to the interaction between voter and election worker.</p>
<p>Beyond the general competence of election workers, however, the quality of the voter experience may be influenced merely by prior impressions about <em>who</em> comprises election staff and volunteers. Political and other social science researchers have recognized for some time the power that group identity can have over attitudes and perception <span class="citation" data-cites="xiao2016 xiao2012 vanbavel2021">(<a href="#ref-vanbavel2021" role="doc-biblioref">Van Bavel and Packer 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-xiao2016" role="doc-biblioref">Xiao, Coppin, and Van Bavel 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-xiao2012" role="doc-biblioref">Xiao and Van Bavel 2012</a>)</span>. As such, we can expect that information identifying the particular groups being recruited to serve as election staff will be enough to improve trust and confidence in election administration, and lessen expectations of electoral fraud. The next section elaborates on why military veterans are of particular interest in this regard.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-veterans" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-veterans">Why Veterans</h2>
<p>Election officials are likely to be agnostic as to who dedicates their time to civil service such as election work. Staffing issues have been an issue since at least the 1990s <span class="citation" data-cites="maidenberg1996 ferrer2024">(<a href="#ref-ferrer2024" role="doc-biblioref">Ferrer, Thompson, and Orey 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-maidenberg1996" role="doc-biblioref">Maidenberg 1996</a>)</span>. In 2020, such efforts were made far more difficult by the COVID-19 pandemic <span class="citation" data-cites="mena2020 abbate2020a">(<a href="#ref-abbate2020a" role="doc-biblioref">Abbate 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-mena2020" role="doc-biblioref">Mena 2020</a>)</span>. Thereâs no special reason to target veterans for recruitment above other groups. Indeed, thereâs no reason to discriminate recruitment efforts at all if the point is purely to fill staffing vacancies.</p>
<p>The reason why veterans arose as a special subset of the population to consider for this inquiry is because there was a sudden push to target veterans for recruitment efforts that arose shortly after the events on Capitol Hill on January 6th, 2021. After the 2020 election, large efforts were made to recruit military veterans and their families to work or volunteer as election staff <span class="citation" data-cites="wetheveterans2022 nflfootballoperations2022">(<a href="#ref-nflfootballoperations2022" role="doc-biblioref">NFL Football Operations 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-wetheveterans2022" role="doc-biblioref">We The Veterans 2022</a>)</span>. Prior to that point, young people were sometimes given special mention as targets of election worker recruitment efforts <span class="citation" data-cites="powerthepolls2020 herndon2020">(<a href="#ref-herndon2020" role="doc-biblioref">Herndon 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-powerthepolls2020" role="doc-biblioref">Power the Polls 2020</a>)</span>. Generally, however, recruitment efforts cast a wide net, indiscriminate of who applies <span class="citation" data-cites="ross2020 conde2020">(<a href="#ref-conde2020" role="doc-biblioref">Conde 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-ross2020" role="doc-biblioref">Ross 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>One can speculate that the motivation to associate military veterans with civic engagement and democracy may be intended to counter negative perceptions and impressions given by the proportion of veteran service members arrested for taking part in the events on January 6th <span class="citation" data-cites="milton2021 loewenson2023 jensen2022a">(<a href="#ref-jensen2022a" role="doc-biblioref">Jensen, Yates, and Kane 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-loewenson2023" role="doc-biblioref">Loewenson 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-milton2021" role="doc-biblioref">Milton and Mines 2021</a>)</span>. Especially with regard to research demonstrating that willingness to support violent efforts to overturn election results (in support of Trump) is, on average, more common among veterans than among matched samples of non-veterans <span class="citation" data-cites="pape2024">(<a href="#ref-pape2024" role="doc-biblioref">Pape et al. 2024</a>)</span>. This is in addition to a strengthened association portrayed in media outlets between military veterans and militias <span class="citation" data-cites="steinhauer2020">(<a href="#ref-steinhauer2020" role="doc-biblioref">Steinhauer 2020</a>)</span>. Prior research has substantiated such a connection between veterans and militia groups. <span class="citation" data-cites="cooter2024">Cooter (<a href="#ref-cooter2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> notes from her 3-year ethnographic fieldwork among Michigan militia members that, ââ¦approximately 40% of militia leaders and 30% of members had previous military experience. Most of these veterans actively sought out such groups, as opposed to being recruited by themâ <span class="citation" data-cites="cooter2024 cooter2013">(<a href="#ref-cooter2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>; see also <a href="#ref-cooter2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cooter 2013</a>)</span>. Thus, countering such associations by promoting a different image of veterans to the mass public and veterans alike seems like a reasonable motivation. Yet such speculation is just that.</p>
<p>That being said, the general public perception, attitudes, or even stereotypes about military veterans are significant to consider. Although military recruitment shows a downward trend as of late, public perceptions of veterans are overwhelmingly positive <span class="citation" data-cites="kleykamp2023">(<a href="#ref-kleykamp2023" role="doc-biblioref">Kleykamp, Schwam, and Wenig 2023</a>)</span>. Veterans are a particularly potent group where mention of veteran status seems to have a positive, calming, or nullifying effect on attitudes. For instance, recent research shows that, during his campaign in the 2020 Democratic Primaries, Pete Buttigiegâs military background mitigated discrimination against him when he was presented as a veteran married to a man <span class="citation" data-cites="magni2024">(<a href="#ref-magni2024" role="doc-biblioref">Magni and Reynolds 2024</a>)</span>. Similar research has also found that a candidateâs veteran status affords them better evaluations regarding competency in particular issue areas (e.g., war competence) <span class="citation" data-cites="hardy2019">(<a href="#ref-hardy2019" role="doc-biblioref">Hardy et al. 2019</a>)</span>. Moreover, veteran status seems to mitigate or nullify usual stigmas associated with mental illness. That is to say, there is negative stigma associated with mental illness <span class="citation" data-cites="corrigan2002">(<a href="#ref-corrigan2002" role="doc-biblioref">Corrigan et al. 2002</a>)</span> and such stigma incurs labor market discrimination <span class="citation" data-cites="hipes2016">(<a href="#ref-hipes2016" role="doc-biblioref">Hipes et al. 2016</a>)</span>, but evidence suggests that veteran status overrides such stigma and discrimination <span class="citation" data-cites="maclean2014">(<a href="#ref-maclean2014" role="doc-biblioref">MacLean and Kleykamp 2014</a>)</span>. Or, in another light, mental illness is seemingly more <em>understandable</em> (i.e., permissible) for veterans given the presumptive reasons for their mental strife. And media framing as such plays an important role on public perception <span class="citation" data-cites="kleykamp2015">(<a href="#ref-kleykamp2015" role="doc-biblioref">Kleykamp and Hipes 2015</a>)</span>.</p>

<section id="theory-and-hypotheses" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="theory-and-hypotheses">Theory and Hypotheses</h2>
<p>Considering the generally positive perception afforded to veterans by the public, it is reasonable to suspect that efforts that promote recruitment of veterans and their family members to work as election staff and volunteers would boost public <em>confidence in elections administration</em>. Indeed, that is the primary hypothesis of this study. Although citizens may vote in various ways across the country (e.g., by mail, ballot drop box, in-person), the simple announcement that election officials are engaging in efforts to recruit veterans to work as election staff may boost confidence in elections administration regardless of how, or whether, an individual plans to vote. Formally,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>H<sub>1</sub>: Announcements that election officials are recruiting miilitary service veterans to work as election staff and volunteers will be associated with greater confidence in elections administration compared to announcements that do not mention military veterans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asking participants whether they supported programs intent on recruiting anyone to work as election staff would garner support regardless of the target group. Considering that support and admiration for veterans is generally high among the population <span class="citation" data-cites="kleykamp2023">(<a href="#ref-kleykamp2023" role="doc-biblioref">Kleykamp, Schwam, and Wenig 2023</a>)</span>, then discerning the impact on oneâs confidence would require a survey experiment designed to determine whether publicized recruitment efforts targeting veterans as a group would have any special effect on confidence in elections administration.</p>
<p>Since the results and events following the 2020 election loomed large in anticipation of the U.S. 2024 general elections, it is reasonable to take into account beliefs about legitimacy of the 2020 election. This group who denies the legitimacy of the 2020 election results were possibly the most apprehensive (distrusting) of the 2024 election. However, given that veteran service members are held in high regard, generally speaking, announcing that veterans are being actively recruited to work as election staff and volunteers is expected to positively influence confidence in elections among those who remained firm in the belief that the 2020 election results were illegitimate. I take into account that legitimacy beliefs about the 2020 election and expectations of electoral fraud are related to partisanship and include partisanship as a control in the analysis<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In addition, I expect that both expectations of electoral fraud and concerns for voter safety would lessen (shrink) when presented with information that veterans are being actively recruited to work and volunteer in election offices.</p>
<p>Finally, prior research has shown that confidence that oneâs own vote would be counted as intended has been much stronger than confidence that votes nationwide would be treated likewise <span class="citation" data-cites="sances2015 stewart2022">(<a href="#ref-sances2015" role="doc-biblioref">Sances and Stewart 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-stewart2022" role="doc-biblioref">Stewart 2022</a>)</span>. In other words, the public is more trusting of elections closer to home. Taking into account that confidence is lower for elections conducted outside of oneâs local area, then information that veterans are being recruited to help conduct elections in locations beyond oneâs locale may close this gap between confidence in elections within oneâs local area and confidence in elections elsewhere. Although it may be difficult to discern whether recruiting veteran service members would improve confidence in elections near oneâs local area in light of such hometown favoritism, a positive effect on confidence in elections held beyond oneâs local areaâwhere confidence is already expectedly lowerâcan help discern the impact of the group alone on public opinion. Therefore, any observed disparity of confidence in elections (i.e., the âconfidence gapâ) between elections within oneâs local area and elections beyond will be smaller among those who are presented with information about election official recruitment efforts of veteran service members.</p>
</section>
<section id="experiment-design-and-survey-measures" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="experiment-design-and-survey-measures">Experiment Design and Survey Measures</h2>
<p>To test the theory that publicized efforts to recruit veterans to work as election staff and volunteers would improve confidence in elections and ease insecurity, a recent experiment was embedded in a survey developed and conducted by the Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement (CDCE) at the University of Maryland. The survey was fielded from August 29th, 2024 to September 18th, 2024 on a non-probability sample of 1,287 U.S. citizens 18 years of age or older. Respondents were randomly split into either the treatment (<span class="math inline">\(n =\)</span> 650) control (<span class="math inline">\(n =\)</span> 637) conditions<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Survey participants read either a treatment or control vignette, which resembled a news article about efforts in Maricopa County, AZ to recruit election staff and volunteers for the 2024 general election<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. The treatment vignette referred to a program designed to recruit veterans and their family members and describes an interviewee âJordan Braxtonâ as an Army veteran. The control vignette simply omitted any mention of veterans and their family members, and didnât describe âJordan Braxtonâ as an Army veteran. Beyond those small differences and the headlines, the article vignettes are identical. Therefore, effects can be attributed to the information about veterans in the treatment vignette<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Maricopa County, AZ was chosen as the setting of the story in the vignette due to the increased scrutiny levied toward election administration there after the 2020 election <span class="citation" data-cites="giles2021 maricopacountyelectionsdepartment2022">(<a href="#ref-giles2021" role="doc-biblioref">Giles 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-maricopacountyelectionsdepartment2022" role="doc-biblioref">Maricopa County Elections Department 2022</a>)</span>. Because of this, treatment effects are potentially limited or constrained to attitudes concerning the location specified in the vignette. A block of survey items asked specifically about Maricopa County, AZ, followed by an identical block of items that asked the same questions about oneâs local area. Later, I compare and discuss results between the items pertaining to different settings.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades it became commonplace for national polls to gauge public confidence in election administration (i.e., voter confidence) by asking some variety of the question, âHow confident are you that your vote [will be/was] counted as you intended in the most recent election?â <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2009 sances2015 stewart2022">(<a href="#ref-hall2009" role="doc-biblioref">T. E. Hall, Quin Monson, and Patterson 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-sances2015" role="doc-biblioref">Sances and Stewart 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-stewart2022" role="doc-biblioref">Stewart 2022</a>)</span>. In addition, since 2008, the Survey of the Performance of American Elections (SPAE) has included a good number of relevant questions to more thoroughly assess trust and confidence in election administration. Such questions inquire into the voter experience with the institution more directly. This study borrows, modifies, or takes inspiration from certain question items found within the 2022 SPAE and other survey items from the Pew Research Centerâs 2018 American Trends Panel wave 38 <span class="citation" data-cites="dunn2018">(<a href="#ref-dunn2018" role="doc-biblioref">Dunn 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The items in this study all inquire into confidence over oneâs expectations in anticipation of upcoming elections. In addition, the survey of this study focused on attitudes regarding election workers such as election officials, staff, and volunteers specific to the location mentioned in the vignetteâMaricopa County, AZâas well as specific to oneâs local area<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The survey included items that assessed both trust in elections administration and expectations of electoral fraud, referred to simply as <em>trust</em> and <em>distrust</em>, respectively. Responses from these two sets of items were utilized to construct the primary dependent variable, <em>confidence in elections</em>.</p>
<p>Prior to the reading the treatment or control vignette, participants responded to distinct survey items assessing oneâs favorability to local election officials (âIn general, how favorable or unfavorable is your impression of local election officials?â) and legitimacy of the 2020 election results (âRegardless of whom you supported in the 2020 election, do you think Joe Bidenâs election as president was legitimate, or was he not legitimately elected?â). The former presented five response options from âStrongly favorableâ to âStrongly unfavorableâ; the latter item presented a binary of either âLegitimateâ or âNot Legitimateâ.</p>
<p>The conventional multiple item assessment of partisanship was included and used to construct a variable of partisanship consisting of three categories: Democrat, Republican, and independent.</p>
<p>Finally, a pair of survey items assessed concerns for potential violence and confidence in voter safety. The pair was asked once in regard to Maricopa County, AZ and again with respect to oneâs local area<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
<section id="trust-and-distrust-in-elections" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trust-and-distrust-in-elections">Trust and Distrust in Elections</h3>
<p>A set of five survey items measured public trust in elections by inquiring into the degree of confidence that votes will be counted as voters intend, confidence that electoral systems are secure from technological threats, perceived commitment of election staff, confidence that outcomes will be fair, and confidence that the voting process will be fair. Each item in this series presented four response options from âNot at all [confident/committed]â, âNot too [confident/committed]â, âSomewhat [confident/committed]â, and âVery [confident/committed]â. In total, five survey items measure different aspects of trust in elections administration.</p>

<p>Another series of five survey items captured an individualâs level of <em>distrust</em> in elections administration based on the extent to which they expect electoral fraud to occur. These items were prefaced with the question, âHow likely do you think any or all of the following will happen during this yearÂ´s elections in [Maricopa County, AZ/ your local area]?â Each item presented four response options: âNot likely at allâ, âNot too likelyâ, âSomewhat likelyâ, and âVery likelyâ.</p>
<p>Similar to the items capturing trust in elections (<a href="#tbl-1" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a>), I computed a summated score for each respondent reflecting the extent of their distrust in elections.</p>
<p>Upon construction of the two summated scales of <em>trust</em> and <em>distrust</em>, internal consistency reliability coefficient <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> were estimated for both and found to be adequate (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> &gt; 0.8); the trust in elections scale <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> = 0.93 and the distrust scale <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> = 0.86. In other words, the items in each of the scales were intercorrelated well enough for each to compose a single scale presuming a unidimensional construct for each<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="data-specification" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-specification">Data Specification</h2>
<p>The primary outcome of interest concerns public confidence in elections administration compensated by oneâs distrust in elections, i.e., their expectations of electoral fraud. Because trust and distrust are assessed by multiple Likert items, conventional methods call for combining the items of each set into separate Likert scales (also known as summated rating scales). However, many of the items comprising the trust scale directly oppose items capturing distrust. For instance, one item from the trust scale has the respondent report their confidence that votes will be counted as voterâs intend, whereas a separate item from the distrust scale has the the respondent report their expectation that many votes will not be counted. Positive responses to these two items directly contradict each other, and would thus cancel out.</p>
<p>In light of this, I reverse coded items on the distrust scale and combined responses to the trust in elections scale. That is, item responses on the trust scale ranged from 0 (âNot confident at allâ) to 3 (âVery confident), whereas responses on the distrust scale ranged from 0 (âNot likely at allâ) to -3 (âVery likelyâ). Combining responses in this way resulted in an overall measure of <em>confidence in elections</em> to serve as the dependent variable<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>. On this scale, positive values reflect higher confidence in elections, negative values reflect greater distrust, and values closer to zero correspond to an individualâs degree of <em>insecurity</em>.</p>

<section id="results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results">Results</h2>
<p>I first review responses to the survey items capturing trust and distrust separately by treatment condition. When distinguished by experiment condition, trust in elections admin is noticeably higher for those who read the treatment vignette. The difference is more pronounced for some items over others. That being said, there is a definite distinction between items pertaining to Maricopa County, AZ compared to items that pertain to a respondentâs local area. In fact, as expected, the treatment appears to have hardly made a difference when the items concerned oneâs local area.</p>

<p>Reviewing item responses distinguished by treatment condition reveals particulars of the treatment effect (<a href="#fig-patch10" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>). Among the items that asked about Maricopa County, AZ, it is a bit easier to see upon which items the treatment vignette had the greatest effect. It appears that the main effect of the treatment is upon responses to the item that measures confidence in the security of election technology.</p>
<p>Regarding confidence in the commitment of election staff and volunteers, a higher proportion of respondents in the treatment group selected âVery confidentâ over âSomewhat confidentâ compared to the control group, but only for items concerning Maricopa County, AZ. Although confidence in election workers was generally high across the board, the shift from âSomewhatâ to âVeryâ confident for items pertaining to election worker <em>commitment</em> to fairness and accuracy seems to clearly speak to the group being recruited, i.e., veterans and family members. However, the same visible shift in proportion from âSomewhatâ to âVeryâ confident isnât observed when items asked about oneâs local area. It may be the case that respondents harbor particular attitudes or sentiment about Maricopa County, AZ itself, or there may be nothing uniquely special about Maricopa County, AZ supposing that elections anywhere beyond oneâs local area generally garner slightly less confidence.</p>
<p>What this does suggest, however, is that trust in the fairness and accuracy of the electoral process is notably higher upon the notion that military veterans will be directly engaged as election staff and volunteers in places where such trust falters. The question turns to whether this also lowers distrust, or the extent to which one expects electoral fraud to occur.</p>

<p>Similar to the trust scale items, the items on the distrust scale were associated with lower distrust in the treatment condition compared to the control. A quick glance at <a href="#fig-patch11" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a> shows what appears to be a significant reduction in distrust, especially regarding the expectations that many votes wouldnât be counted, many voters would be turned away, and that election officials would discourage voters from casting a ballot. Interestingly, the expectation that there would be foreign interference in elections in Maricopa County, AZ were pretty resilient against the treatment. And again, responses for items pertaining to elections in oneâs local area are practically indistinguishable between treatment and control.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="confidence-in-elections">Confidence in elections</h3>
<p>Once trust and distrust were composed into unified variable of confidence in elections, I then examined distribution of the dependent variable followed by analysis of the effect of the treatment by comparison of mean differences between experiment conditions. Recall that on this scale, zero reflects insecurity (e.g., similar or equal values of trust and distrust), whereas values diverging from zero reflect confidence in either direction, trust or distrust respectively. Positive values reflect trust in elections administration (e.g., elections will be fair and accurate), whereas negative values reflect distrust in elections (i.e., expectation that election fraud will occur). To retain a meaningful zero, I rescaled the sum scores to range from -3 to 3<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> and then superimposed two histograms of confidence scores: one derived from AZ items and another for scores derived from local area items. Doing this is illustrative of the relative distribution of confidence that differed depending on the location of elections referred to in the survey items (e.g., Maricopa County, AZ).</p>
<p>As revealed by review of the item responses, the distribution of confidence differed depending on whether survey items pertained to elections in Maricopa County, AZ, or elections within oneâs local area.</p>

<p>Overall, the sample expressed more trust in elections relative to distrust seeing as how the distribution of confidence is largely positive (<a href="#fig-dist" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>). However, thereâs a clear difference between confidence in Maricopa county, AZ elections and elections within oneâs local area. A paired t-test confirms that this difference was statistically significant, though somewhat small (mean difference <span class="math inline">\(= 0.325\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> CI <span class="math inline">\([0.27, 0.38]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(1286) = 11.61\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>). Nonetheless, respondents appeared less confident regarding elections in Maricopa County, AZ, but held more confidence in elections administration in their local area. This complements previous research that demonstrates a similar bias favorable to oneâs local area <span class="citation" data-cites="stewart2022">(<a href="#ref-stewart2022" role="doc-biblioref">Stewart 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when confidence levels are distinguished by experiment condition, the treatment vignette only had an effect upon survey items pertaining to elections in Maricopa County, AZ. Conducting an independent samples t-test (i.e., Welch Two Sample t-test) suggests that the effect of the treatment compared to the control condition is positive and statistically significant.</p>

These figures merely illustrate the effect of the treatment with respect to the relationship between trust and distrust; ultimately confidence improves.</p>
<p>Confidence in elections was higher among those who read the treatment vignette but remained conditional on whether the survey questions inquired about elections in Maricopa County, AZ. This evidence suggests that announcing efforts to recruit veterans and their families to work as election staff and volunteers may increase confidence in elections administration in places outside of oneâs local area, but may not boost confidence in elections within oneâs local area.</p>

<p>Among those who refuted the 2020 election results, trust in Maricopa County, AZ elections was lower for each item compared to items pertaining to elections within oneâs local area, regardless of treatment condition. However, notably, trust that election technology would be secure received the lowest confidence endorsement overall.

<p>Concerning distrust among those who refuted the 2020 election results, responses items assessing oneâs expectation that election fraud would occur reveal the same pattern. Although there is not as stark a disparity between responses of those in the treatment and those in the control, among those in the treatment group, there does appear to be less expectation that election fraud would occur in Maricopa County, AZ. Overall, review of responses to trust (<a href="#fig-patch13" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a>) and distrust survey items (<a href="#fig-patch14" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6</a>) does lend credence to the impact of the treatment.</p>
<p>In order to substantiate the overall influence of the treatment on confidence in elections, I regressed the dependent variable confidence on legitimacy beliefs while controlling for partisanship.</p>
<p>The first model in Table <span class="math inline">\(\ref{tbl-legit}\)</span> shows that overall confidence in elections among those who read the treatment vignette was significantly (statistically) greater than those who read the control, on average and netting out the effects of partisanship and legitimacy beliefs. Democratic partisanship remains marginally significant at <span class="math inline">\(90\%\)</span> confidence level (<span class="math inline">\(p = 0.055\)</span>). Not believing the 2020 election of Joe Biden was legitimate is negatively associated with confidence in elections. In order to assess the magnitude of this interaction effect of the treatment on those who refuted the 2020 election results, I ran a model where confidence in elections was regressed on the interaction between the treatment and legitimacy beliefs, controlling for partisanship.</p>
<p>Thereâs a positive interaction effect of the treatment vignette among those who believe that the 2020 election was not legitimate, on average and controlling for partisanship. This shows that the treatment effect was most influential upon those who believe the 2020 election results were illegitimate. The treatment alone does not reverse such beliefs, but this shows where its influence was most potent.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Publicized announcements that election officials are actively recruiting former military service members to work as election staff and volunteers is associated with slightly greater confidence in elections compared to election worker recruitment announcements that do not explicitly mention targeted recruitment of former military service members. Moreover, increased levels of confidence is limited to elections beyond oneâs local area and, of course, in anticipation of election night. Whether the increase in confidence is sustained post-election night cannot be inferred from these results.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that confidence in elections for oneâs local area is already higher than for those beyond. Thus, thereâs already more insecurity concerning elections elsewhere for whatever reason. In the anticipatory period prior to national elections, publicized efforts to recruit veterans to work as election staff and volunteers may be a small, but positive, step towards reducing insecurity in elections that occur elsewhere. Especially among those who maintained a steadataast degree of distrust in elections. Despite a lack of evidence that systematic electoral fraud had occurred in the 2020 election, a substantial proportion of the population were unwilling to affirm the legitimacy of the results. However, despite such legitimacy beliefs, most were not consistent as they expressed varying levels of trust in different aspects of elections administration.</p>
<p>These results speaks more to the influence that military veterans have among those who distrust the electoral process and refute the legitimacy of prior outcomes than it does to the public more generally. In general, public confidence appears strongest when the elections under consideration regard those within oneâs local community. Yet, such strong confidence is not generalized outward to the institution of elections administration as a whole. Insecurity in the integrity of the electoral process and its administration may be naturally higher for elections that occur further from home. Whether that is due to some local favorability bias or some outward negativity bias is hard to say. And seeing as how insecurity presents vulnerability, it is perhaps far easier to inspire a general sense of distrust in the process and its administration in places not near and around oneâs local area.</p>

<div class="line-block"><strong>Local Military Veterans Recruited for Election Jobs in Maricopa County</strong><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;PHOENIX (AP) â Election officials in Maricopa County, Arizona, announced a program designed to recruit military veterans and their family members from the community to serve as election administrators, including election polling place workers, temporary workers, and full-time staff. As the U.S. general elections in November near, election officials must fill several thousand temporary positions and hundreds of other open positions to ensure sufficient staffing for the 2024 elections and beyond.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Army veteran Jordan Braxton just joined the elections workforce. Jordan believes their role is important to ensuring a secure, accurate, and transparent election, âMany places are short on staff this election cycle. I served my country in the Army, and I want to do my part as a veteran and a citizen to ensure that everyone trusts the process and the outcome of the election.â</div>

<h1 class="appendix">Appendix C: Polychoric Item and Score Correlations of Trust and Distrust</h1>
<section id="trust-and-distrust" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trust-and-distrust">Trust and Distrust</h2>
<p>Polychoric correlation is a measure of association between two ordered categorical variables each assumed to represent (i.e., indicate, be influenced by) two normally distributed, continuous, latent variables. Due to the fact that each item is an ordered categorical variable assumed to represent one of two latent constructs (i.e., trust or distrust, respectively), I examined polychoric correlations between the items used to construct each scale. In addition, one set of the trust and distrust items pertained to Maricopa County, AZ, whereas the other set of items were identical except that these items pertained to oneâs local area.</p>
<p>Since the two sets of items (AZ items and Local items) are, in theory, supposed to capture the same normally distributed continuous latent variables, then the polychoric inter-item correlations should be significantly associated, strong, and in the same direction for the items that measure trust regardless of whether the items pertain to AZ or oneâs local area (likewise for distrust). Simply, trust/distrust in elections in AZ should strongly and positively be associated with trust/distrust in elections in oneâs local area.</p>
<p>Additionally, the items that indicate trust should negatively correlate with items that indicate distrust. Furthermore, the strength of the negative correlations between trust and distrust should closely approximate if not match.</p>

<p>Indeed, this is what is revealed by the correlation matrix (<a href="#fig-polycor" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;8</a>). Trust items correlate positively, strongly, and are significant regardless of location at which the items pertain. The same goes for distrust items. Also, items meant to measure trust negatively correlate with the items that measure distrust. However, the positive correlations are not nearly as high as would be expected supposing that the items are nearly identical theoretical indicators of the same hypothetical constructs, i.e., trust and distrust respectively.</p>
<p>If the items accurately measure trust/distrust in elections regardless of where those elections are said to take place, then positive correlations between the AZ and Local area items should approach perfect correlation as though the same exact questions were asked twice. This result, however, suggests that the location of which the survey items pertain (and perhaps other factors) makes a substantial difference in the pattern of responses, but also raises valid questions as to whether the items accurately measure the latent variable constructs in the first place.</p>
<p>Although I do not explicitly assume that the survey instruments perfectly measure the hypothetical constructs of interest (i.e., trust and distrust), perfect measurement is implicitly assumed by the method of combining multiple item responses into a sum or mean composite score.</p>
<p>In short, I expected item responses from the trust and distrust scales to be inversely correlated among the sample, but not mutually exclusive. Indeed, this is what I find. Polychoric correlations between the trust and distrust items negatively correlate as expected, as does the correlation between the two sum score scales. Given the ordinal nature of the variable items, I conducted a Spearmanâs rank correlation test <span class="citation" data-cites="spearman1907">(<a href="#ref-spearman1907" role="doc-biblioref">Spearman 1907</a>)</span> and found a negative correlation of <span class="math inline">\(\rho = -0.49\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> CI [-0.53, -0.44]; Kendallâs <span class="math inline">\(\tau = -0.39\)</span>) between scores on the two scales for the AZ items (For the local item scale score correlation: <span class="math inline">\(\rho = -0.52\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> CI [-0.56, -0.48]; Kendallâs <span class="math inline">\(\tau = -0.39\)</span>). The negative correlation between the trust and distrust items and scores makes intuitive sense.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I adopt a distinction made between <em>trustworthiness</em> and <em>trust</em> in elections <span class="citation" data-cites="stewart2022">(<a href="#ref-stewart2022" role="doc-biblioref">Stewart 2022</a>)</span>. The â<em>worthiness</em>â of oneâs trust in the conduct and administration of elections is based on the extent that outcomes of an election reasonably follow the rules prescribed and can be adjudicated as such. The publicâs <em>trust</em> in elections, however, is amendable to an indefinite number of factors that may be unrelated to the formal structure or procedures of election administration. I can recognize that my car is trustworthy prior to ever driving it because it is structurally sound; I have every reason to deem it <em>worthy of my trust</em>. However, I donât trust my car because I am sure it is haunted.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">â©ï¸</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Thereâs little that could justify a conceptual distinction between public trust pre-election and public trust post-election. The temporal element renders the difference between pre- and post-election more operative than conceptual at a foundational level.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">â©ï¸</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>The vignettes written were based on real news stories<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">â©ï¸</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>To be clear, I conducted an auxiliary regression analysis to examine the relationship between legitimacy beliefs and partisanship. Results revealed a statistically significant relationship between the two variables and thus omitting either would result in biased estimates.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">â©ï¸</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Demographic breakdown of the sample are included in Appendix B.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">â©ï¸</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>The article vignettes were written and designed by Michael Hanmer Ph.D and myself with input from We the Veterans, a non-profit organization<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">â©ï¸</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Complete text of treatment and control vignettes are included in the Appendix<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">â©ï¸</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Note that I refer to the items as either âAZ itemsâ or âlocal itemsâ in order to distinguish the location in which they pertain.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">â©ï¸</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>Survey item wording and responses are included in Appendix A.<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">â©ï¸</a></p></li>

<li id="fn11"><p>The methodological concerns between the use of (unit weighted) sum or mean scores compared to the use of estimated factor scores for Likert scales composed of multiple Likert items are legion. The use of either computed sum scores or estimated factor scores as a general practice is continuously debated <span class="citation" data-cites="mcneish2020 widaman2022 mcneish2023 widaman2024">(<a href="#ref-mcneish2023" role="doc-biblioref">McNeish 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-mcneish2020" role="doc-biblioref">McNeish and Wolf 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-widaman2022" role="doc-biblioref">Widaman and Revelle 2022</a>, <a href="#ref-widaman2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>, yet there is no general consensus on the most appropriate method generally. The use of either appears to largely depend on the researcherâs particular research objective, theoretical suppositions, and necessity. Another common concern is the inappropriate treatment of ordinal variables as interval which levy strong assumptions, e.g., each item contributes equally to the variable being measured and that ordinal response categories are equidistant as though on an interval scale <span class="citation" data-cites="wang2013 robitzsch2020">(<a href="#ref-wang2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wang et al. 2013</a>; for contrast, see <a href="#ref-robitzsch2020" role="doc-biblioref">Robitzsch 2020</a>)</span>.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">â©ï¸</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>This range is mostly arbitrary, as a range from -1 to 1 works much the same. When relying on simple sum total score, the scale ranges from -15 to 15. So a single point increase from 0 to 1 may reflect a combination of a single âVery confidentâ response on a trust item compensated by a single âSomewhat likelyâ response on a distrust item (i.e., 3-2 = 1), or some other equivalent combination. Although the use of mean scores would place scores back onto the response scale metric (e.g., from 0 to 3, reflective of ânot at allâ to âveryâ), this results in a unipolar scale (from 0 to 3). The bipolar scale resulting from the composition of positive trust and negative distrust engenders meaning to zero and negative values. As such, composite mean scores become inappropriate and interpretation of scores would no longer be feasible. In other words, negative values on the scale for confidence in elections hold substantive meaning (e.g., distrust, absent trust), which makes transforming scores to fit a unipolar scale inappropriate.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">â©ï¸</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>What is interesting to note here is that the first three items regard the more human element of the election administration process, e.g., ensuring accuracy of counts, competence, and commitment of election workers. Although a neat line canât really be drawn between the first three and latter two items presented here, it is interesting to see a slight divergence from the usual high confidence placed in local area elections.<a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">â©ï¸</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>Independent âleanersâ were grouped into the respective party affiliation in which they lean.<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">â©ï¸</a></p></li>
